I liked Blake and \nTaylor, but Sylvester’s a little s*** and I can relate to that.\n– Each of Wildbow’s serials have started with an italicized thought. \nThis one strikes me as pretty killer. Especially after Pact’s “Damn me, \ndamn them, damn it all,” which left me cold. But this one? Academic and \njust a lil unsettling.\n– Sylvester’s hair refuses to be tamed by wax, while Jamie’s is just \nlong. I’m curious to unravel the paradox of these wild, feral-seeming \nchildren somehow having a connection to The Academy.\n– This isn’t really much of a thought, but damn I love that Sylvester’s name is shortened to “Sly.” Just… damn.\n– I’m glad we’re starting with an ensemble. Wildbow’s been pretty \ngood at writing those since Worm, and his dialogue has improved so \ndrastically (I’d argue it’s where he’s shown the most growth).\n– “The gears were shifting in his head.” That line really says a lot \nabout Sylvester’s industrialized way of thinking.

Namely, you have a tendency of sometimes producing very wordy \nverbal descriptions of physical settings that are not very easy to read,\n and really distract from the telling of the story. Here is an example \nright at the beginning of Twig:\n“What had once been a barn had been made into a warehouse, then \nabandoned partway through a third set of changes.  A floor of old wooden\n slats reached only halfway down the length of the old building, what \nhad once been a hayloft.  If we stood on the edge, we could look down at\n the floor below to see uneven floorboards on top of compacted dirt.  \nThe original barn’s door was still there, mounted on rollers.  I leaned \nover to get a better look.  I could see a table, some scattered papers, \nbooks, and a blackboard.  The only light was that which came in through \nwindows.  A scattered set placed on the upper floor, and more well above\n head height on the lower one.”\nConvoluted wording, hard to picture precisely. Very much an element \nof the writing in Pact that I had serious trouble with. And– I would \nsuggest– absolutely not the sort of thing you want in one of the first \nparagraphs of a new story, where you are looking to ensnare readers \nwithout long descriptions of setting (unless such descriptions were \nreally compelling, which this is not).\nPerhaps the hardest thing for me as a reader when I come across these\n descriptions is why you considered those particular physical details so\n important as to put on paper. I would like for physical descriptions to\n be much more natural and organic, and flow seamlessly with the story \nitself.\nAnyway, that’s my honest feedback as a longtime reader.\nWishing you all the best with your new venture, and I will continue \nto read what you write and support your efforts as long as possible.\n'], ['235', 'Last Place |', '2015-03-10T19:15:48+00:00', '1', 'Had to sit down and force myself to \nwait all day just like Pact.

On the whole, this read somewhat like CSI \nor a “get the culprit” story. Politics of some sort are quite clearly \nvisible in the future. And, at the expense of dragging the past into \nthis, it’s soooooo nice to be on the side of the Law this time. I hope.\nThe main mystery (for me) is what are they? Not biologically or \nanything, I’d like to think they’re “regular” humans for a change, but \nwhat kind of people are all these “scientists”, these alchemists and \nbuilders and probable madmen and women? There is the Academy. How does \nthat work too?\n… and I should maybe start reading the next chapter instead of blindly speculating.\nAlso. What will become of the hybrid now that its creator is dead?\n'], ['917', 'Psycho Gecko |', '2015-03-24T21:36:21+00:00', '1', '…but Deedee blows his experiments, to smithereens!

Not that our POV character could tell us that much about it after \nthe older man splashed fluids all over the kid.
