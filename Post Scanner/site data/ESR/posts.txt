[['ESR', '7111', 'Too clever by half', 'Eric Raymond', '2016-04-07T13:07:19+00:00', '\n\t\tThe British have a phrase &#8220;Too clever by half&#8221;,  It needs to go global, especially among hackers. It can have any of several closely related meanings: the one I mean to focus on here has to do with overconfidence in one&#8217;s intelligence or skill, and the particular bad consequences that can have.  It&#8217;s related to Nassim Taleb&#8217;s concept of a &#8220;fragilista&#8221;.\n\nThis came up recently when I posted about building a new mailserver out of a packaged fanless mini-ITX system.  My stated goal was to reduce my mailserver&#8217;s power dissipation in order to (eventually) collect a net savings on my utility bill.\nCertain of my commenters immediately crapped all over this idea, describing it as overkill and insisting that I ought to be using something with even lower power draw; the popular suggestion was a Raspberry Pi.  It was when I objected to the absence of a battery-backed-up RTC (real-time clock) on the Pi that the real fun started.\nThe pro-Pi people airily dismissed this objection.  One observed that you can get an RTC hat for the Pi.  Some others waxed sarcastic about the maintainer of GPSD and the NTPsec tech lead not trusting his own software; a GPS to supply time, or NTP to take time corrections over the net, should (they claim) be a perfectly adequate substitute for an RTC.\nAnd so they would be&#8230;under optimal conditions, with everything working perfectly, and a software bridge that hasn&#8217;t been written yet. Best case would be that your GPS hat has a solid satellite lock when you boot and sets the system clock within the first second.  Only, oops, GPSD as it is doesn&#8217;t actually have the capability to set the system clock directly.  It has to go through ntpd or chrony.\nSo now you have to have a time service daemon installed, properly configured, and running for the timestamps on your system logs to look sane.  Well, unless your GPS doesn&#8217;t have sat lock.  Or you&#8217;re booting without a network connection for diagnostic or fault isolation reasons. Now your cleverness has gotten you nowhere; your machine could believe it&#8217;s near 0 in the Unix epoch (Midnight, January 1st 1970) for an arbitrary amount of time.  \nWhy is this a problem?  One very mundane reason is that logfile analyzers don&#8217;t necessarily deal well with large jumps in the system clock, like the one that will happen when the system time finally gets set; if you have to troubleshoot boot-time behavior later.  Another is cron jobs firing inappropriately. Yet another is that the implementations for various network protocols can get confused by large time skew, even if they&#8217;re formally supposed to be able to handle it.\nAnd I left out the fact that outright setting the system clock isn&#8217;t normal behavior for an NTP daemon, either.  What it&#8217;s actually designed to do is collect small amounts of drift by speeding up or slowing down the clock until system time matches NTP time.  And why is it designed to do this? If you guessed &#8220;because too many applications get upset by jumping time&#8221; you get a prize.\nYou can certainly tell an NTP daemon to set time rather than skewing the clock rate.  But you do have to tell it to do that.  This is a configuration knob that can be gotten wrong.\nAre we perhaps beginning to see the problem here?\nEngineering is tradeoffs.  When you optimize for one figure of merit (like low cost) you are likely to end up pessimizing another, like proliferating possible failure modes.  This is especially likely if an economy measure like leaving out an RTC requires interlocking compensations like having a GPS hat and configuring your time-service daemon exactly right.\nThe &#8220;too clever by half&#8221; mindset often wants to optimize demonstrating its own cleverness.  This, of course, is something hackers are particularly prone to.  It can be a virtue of sorts when you&#8217;re doing exploratory design, but not when you&#8217;re engineering a production system.  I&#8217;m not the first person to point out that if you write code that&#8217;s as clever as you can manage, it&#8217;s probably too tricky for you to debug.\nA particularly dangerous form of too clever by half is when you assume that you are smart enough for your design to head off all failure modes.  This is the mindset Nassim Taleb calls &#8220;fragilista&#8221; &#8211; the overconfident planner who proliferates complexity and failure modes and gets blindsided when his fragile construct collides with messy reality.\nNow I need to introduce the concept of an incident pit.  This is a term invented by scuba divers. It describes a cascade that depends with a small thing going wrong.  You try to fix the small thing, but the fix has an unexpected effect that lands you in more trouble.  You try to fix that thing, don&#8217;t get it quite right, and are in bigger trouble.  Now you&#8217;re under stress and maybe not thinking clearly.  The next mistake is larger&#8230;  A few iterations of this can kill a diver.\nThe term &#8220;incident pit&#8221; has been adopted by paramedics and others who have to make life-critical decisions.  A classic XKCD cartoon, &#8220;Success&#8221;, captures how this applies to hardware and software engineering: \n\nToo clever by half lands you in incident pits.\nHow do you avoid these?  By designing to avoid failure modes. This why &#8220;KISS&#8221; &#8211; Keep It Simple, Stupid&#8221; is an engineering maxim.  Buy the RTC to foreclose the failure modes of not having one.  Choose a small-form-factor system your buddy Phil the expert hardware troubleshooter is already using rather than novel hardware neither of you knows the ins and outs of.\nDon&#8217;t get cute.  Well, not unless your actual objective is to get cute &#8211; if I didn&#8217;t know that playfulness and deliberately pushing the envelope has its place I&#8217;d be a piss-poor hacker. But if you&#8217;re trying to bring up a production mailserver, or a production anything, cute is not the goal and you shouldn&#8217;t let your ego suck you into trying for the cleverest possible maneuver. That way lie XKCD&#8217;s sharks.\nGoogle+ Eric Raymond\t\t\t'], ['ESR', '7095', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', 'Eric Raymond', '2016-04-03T23:08:53+00:00', '\n\t\tThis may be the week the SJWs lost it all&#8230;or, at least, their power to bully people in the hacker culture and the wider tech community.\nMany of you probably already know about the LambdaConf flap.  In brief: LambdaConf, a technical conference on functional programming, accepted a presentation proposal about a language called Urbit, from a guy named Curtis Yarvin.  I&#8217;ve looked at Urbit: it is very weird, but rather interesting, and certainly a worthy topic for a functional programming conference.\nAnd then all hell broke loose. For Curtis Yarvin is better known as Mencius Moldbug, author of eccentric and erudite political rants and a focus of intense hatred by humorless leftists. Me, I&#8217;ve never been able to figure out how much of what Moldbug writes he actually believes; his writing seems designed to leave a reader guessing as to whether he&#8217;s really serious or executing the most brilliantly satirical long-term troll-job in the history of the Internet.\nA mob of SJWs, spearheaded by a no-shit self-described Communist named Jon Sterling, descended on LambdaConf demanding that they cancel Yarvin&#8217;s talk, pretending that he (rather than, say, the Communist) posed a safety threat to other conference-goers.  The conference&#8217;s principal organizers, headed up one John de Goes, quite properly refused to cancel the talk, observing that Yarvin was there to talk about his code and not his politics.\n\nI think they conceded to much to the SJWs, actually, by asking Yarvin to issue a statement about his views on violence. Nobody asked Jon Sterling whether he was down with that whole liquidation of the kulaks thing, after all, and if a Communist who likes to tweet about sending capitalists to &#8220;hard labor in the North&#8221; gets a pass it is not easy to see why any apologia was required from a man with no history of advocating violence at all.\nBut, ultimately, they did make the right decision: to judge Yarvin&#8217;s talk proposal by its technical merit alone.  This is the hacker way.\nThe SJWs then attempted to pressure LambdaConf&#8217;s sponsors into withdrawing their support so the conference would have to be canceled. Several sponsors withdrew (I don&#8217;t know details about who; my sources for this part are secondhand).\nSo far, so wearily familiar &#8211; Marxist thugs versus free expression, with free expression&#8217;s chances not looking so hot. But there&#8217;s where the story gets good.  Meredith Patterson and her friends at the blog Status 451 organized a counterpunch.  They launched an IndieGoGo campaign Save LambdaConf &#8230;and an open society.\nI got wind of this a bit less than two days ago and posted to G+ asking all 20K of my followers to chip in, something I&#8217;ve never done before. Because, like Merry, I understand that this wasn&#8217;t actually about Mencius Moldbug at all &#8211; it was about opposing a power play by the political-correctness police. The IndieGoGo campaign was our chance to strike back for liberty.\nA day later it was fully funded.  ClarkHat&#8217;s victory lap makes great reading.  \nI replied to congratulate ClarkHat: &#8220;@ClarkHat I don&#8217;t often ask my 20K G+ followers to support a crowdfunder,  but when I do it&#8217;s hoping for a victory like this one.&#8221; And today I have 21K followers.\nThe hacker community has spoken, and it put its money where its mouth is, too. Now we know how to stop the SJWs in their tracks &#8211; fund what they denounce, make their hatred an asset, repeatedly kerb-stomp them with proof that their hate campaigns will be countered by the overwhelming will of the people and communities they thought they had bullied into submission.\nI&#8217;m proud of my community for stepping up.  I hope Sir Tim Hunt and Brendan Eich and Matt Taylor and other past victims of PC lynch mobs are smiling tonight. The SJWs&#8217; preference-falsification bubble has popped; with a little work and a few more rounds of demonstration we may be able to prevent future lynchings entirely.\nGoogle+ Eric Raymond\t\t\t'], ['ESR', '7123', 'TPP and the Law of Unintended Consequences', 'Eric Raymond', '2016-04-12T10:33:48+00:00', '\n\t\tOnce upon a time, free-trade agreements were about just that: free trade.  You abolish your tariffs and import restrictions, I&#8217;ll abolish mine.  Trade increases, countries specialize in what they&#8217;re best equipped to do, efficiency increases, price levels drop, everybody wins.\nThen environmentalists began honking about exporting pollution and demanded what amounted to imposing First World regulation on Third World countries who &#8211; in general &#8211; wanted the jobs and the economic stimulus from trade more than they wanted to make environmentalists happy.  But the priorities of poor brown people didn&#8217;t matter to rich white environmentalists who already had theirs, and the environmentalists had political clout in the First World, so they won. Free-trade agreements started to include &#8220;environmental safeguards&#8221;.\nNext, the labor unions, frightened because foreign workers might compete down domestic wages, began honking about abusive Third World labor conditions about which they didn&#8217;t really give a damn.  They won, and &#8220;free trade&#8221; agreements began to include yet more impositions of First World pet causes on Third World countries.  The precedent firmed up: free trade agreements were no longer to be about &#8220;free&#8221; trade, but rather about managing trade in the interests of wealthy First Worlders.\nToday there&#8217;s a great deal of angst going on in the tech community about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Its detractors charge that a &#8220;free-trade&#8221; agreement has been hijacked by big-business interests that are using it to impose draconian intellectual-property rules on the entire world, criminalize fair use, obstruct open-source software, and rent-seek at the expense of developing countries.\nThese charges are, of course, entirely correct.  So here&#8217;s my question: What the hell else did you expect to happen?  Where were you idiots when the environmentalists and the unions were corrupting the process and the entire concept of &#8220;free trade&#8221;?\n\nThe TPP is a horrible agreement.  It&#8217;s toxic.  It&#8217;s a dog&#8217;s breakfast.  But if you stood meekly by while the precedents were being set, or &#8211; worse &#8211; actually approved of imposing rich-world regulation on poor countries, you are partly to blame. \nThe thing about creating political machinery to fuck with free markets is this: you never get to be the last person to control it.  No matter how worthy you think your cause is, part of the cost of your behavior is what will be done with it by the next pressure group.  And the one after that.  And after that.\nThe equilibrium is that political regulatory capability is hijacked by for the use of the pressure group with the strongest incentives to exploit it. Which generally means, in Theodore Roosevelt&#8217;s timeless phrase, &#8220;malefactors of great wealth&#8221;.  The abuses in the TPP were on rails, completely foreseeable, from the first time &#8220;environmental standards&#8221; got written into a trade agreement.\nThat&#8217;s why it will get you nowhere to object to the specifics of the TPP unless you recognize that the entire context in which it evolved is corrupt.  If you want trade agreements to stop being about regulatory carve-outs, you have to stop tolerating that corruption and get back to genuinely free trade.  No exemptions, no exceptions, no sweeteners for favored constituencies, no sops to putatively noble causes.\nIt&#8217;s fine to care about exporting pollution and child labor and such things, but the right way to fix that is by market pressure &#8211; fair trade labeling, naming and shaming offenders, that sort of thing.  If you let the politicians in they&#8217;ll do what they always do: go to the highest bidder and rig the market in its favor.  And then you will get screwed.\nApplication of this principle to domestic policy is left as an easy exercise for the reader.\nGoogle+ Eric Raymond\t\t\t'], ['ESR', '7128', 'The midrange computer dies', 'Eric Raymond', '2016-04-15T08:10:06+00:00', '\n\t\tAbout five years ago I reacted to a lot of hype about the impending death of the personal computer with an observation and a prediction.  The observation was that some components of a computer have to be the size they are because they&#8217;re scaled to human dimensions &#8211; notably screens, keyboards, and pointing devices.  Wander outside certain size extrema and you get things like smartphone keyboards that are only good for limited use.\nHowever, what we normally think of as the heart of a computer &#8211; the processing and storage &#8211; isn&#8217;t like this.  It can get arbitrarily small without impacting usability at all. Consequently, I predicted a future in which people would carry around powerful computing nodes descended from smartphones and walk them to docking stations bundling a screen, a pointing device, and a real keyboard when they need to get real work done.\nWe&#8217;ve now reached an interesting midway point on that road.  The (stationary) computers I use are in the process of bifurcating into two classes: one quite large, one very small.  I qualify that with &#8220;stationary&#8221; because laptops are an exception for reasons which, if not yet obvious, will be in a few paragraphs.\n\nThe &#8220;large&#8221; class is exemplified in my life by the Great Beast of Malvern: my &#8220;desktop&#8221; system, except that it&#8217;s really more like a baby supercomputer optimized for fast memory access to extremely large data sets (as in, surgery on large version-control repositories). This is more power than a typical desktop user would know what to do with, by a pretty large margin -absurd overkill for just running an office suite or video editing or gaming or whatever.\nMy other two stationary production machines are, as of yesterday, a fanless mini-ITX box about the size of a paperback book and a credit-card-sized Raspberry Pi 3.  They arrived on my doorstep around the same time.  The mini-ITX box was a planned replacement for the conventional tower PC I had been using as a mailserver/DNS/bastion host, because I hate moving parts and want to cut my power bills. The Pi was serendipitous, a surprise gift from Dave Taht who&#8217;s trying to nudge me into improving my hardware hacking.  \n(And so I shall; tomorrow I expect to solder  a header onto an Adafruit GPS hat, plug it into the Pi, and turn the combination into a tiny Stratum 1 NTP test machine.)\nAnd now I have three conventional tower PCs in my living room (an old mailserver and two old development workstations) that I&#8217;m trying to get rid of &#8211; free to good home, you must come to Malvern to get them.  Because they just don&#8217;t make sense as service machines any more.  Fanless small-form-factor systems are now good enough to replace almost any computer with functional requirements less than those of a Great-Beast-class monster.\nMy wife still has a tower PC, but maybe not for long. Hers could easily be replaced by something like an Intel NUC &#8211; Intel&#8217;s sexy flagship small-form-factor fanless system, now cheap enough on eBay to be price-competitive with a new tower PC.  And no moving parts, and no noise, and less power draw.\nI have one tower PC left &#8211; the recently decomissioned mailserver.  But the only reason I&#8217;m keeping it is as a courtesy for basement guests &#8211; it&#8217;ll be powered down when we don&#8217;t have one.  But I am seriously thinking of replacing it with another Raspberry Pi set up as a web kiosk.\nI still have a Thinkpad for travel.  When you have to carry your peripherals with you, it&#8217;s a compromise that makes sense.  (Dunno what I&#8217;m going to do when it dies, either &#8211; the quality and design of recent Thinkpads has gone utterly to shit. The new keyboards are particularly atrocious.)\nThere&#8217;s a confluence of factors at work here.  Probably the single most important is cheap solid-state drives.  Without SSDs, small-form-factor systems were mostly cute technology demonstrations &#8211; it didn&#8217;t do a lot of practical good for the rest of the computing/storage core to be a tiny SBC when it had to drag around a big, noisy hunk of spinning rust.  With SSDs everything, including power draw and noise and heat dissipation, scales down in better harmony.\nWhat it adds up to for me is that midrange PCs are dead.  For most uses, SFF (small-form-factor) hardware has reached a crossover point &#8211; their price per unit of computing is now better.\nNext, these SFF systems get smaller and cooler and merge with smartphone technology.  That&#8217;ll take another few years.\nGoogle+ Eric Raymond\t\t\t'], ['ESR', '7151', 'The Rule of Names', 'Eric Raymond', '2016-04-24T01:56:55+00:00', '\n\t\tThis is an entirely silly post about the way I name the machines in my house, shared for the amusement of my regulars.\n\nThe house naming theme is &#8220;comic mythical beasts&#8221;.\nMy personal desktop machine is always named &#8220;snark&#8221;, after Lewis Carroll&#8217;s &#8220;Hunting of the&#8221;.

Its alias through the second IP address was, of course, &#8220;boojum&#8221;.\nMy laptop is always &#8220;golux&#8221;, from James Thurber&#8217;s The Thirteen Clocks.\nThe bastion host (mail and DNS server) is always &#8220;grelber&#8221;, after the insult-spewing Grelber from the Broom Hilda comic strip.  It&#8217;s named not for the insults but because Grelber is depicted as a lurking presence inside a hollow log with a mailbox on the top.\nCathy&#8217;s personal desktop machine is always &#8220;minx&#8221; after a pretty golden-furred creature from Infocom&#8217;s classic Zork games, known for its ability to sniff out buried chocolate truffles.\nThe router is &#8220;quintaped&#8221;, a five-legged creature supposed to live on a magically concealed island in the Potterverse.
