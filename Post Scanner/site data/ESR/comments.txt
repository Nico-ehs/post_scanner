The &#8220;wireheading&#8221; aspect is that is this gets quickly short-cut in the brain: you just do smart things and feel good about yourself, even if nobody knows about it and thus nobody gives you points for this. (This is why the worst cases of this are called intellectual masturbation: masturbation is a similar shortcut between action and brain-reward.)

Then it is good to mock it when others do it &#8211; depending on the situation it is the light, friendly mocking like you do now or in other cases it can be sharper. On the social level, incentives should be structured so that people get actual rewards like money and jobs not out of signalling smartness but actually solving problems.

The point is when external incentives change, &#8220;wireheading&#8221;, the shortcut tends to follow it. Smart people aren&#8217;t stupid, they tend to masturbate with things that are actually pretty similar to the kind of things that actually get them cred and money and other goodies, so if you pay and praise people to jump high they are going to shortcut it at some point and just enjoy jumping and get a self-esteem boost out of doing it  well.

Not everyone can be expected to be extensively familiar with history, the LambdaConf squabble, and/or our host, after all.\n&#8212;\nOne, wrt who did what why, I would identify several closely related stages and aspects here.\nThe first is LambdaConf&#8217;s blind review of Yarvin&#8217;s submission; this I would say is a matter of merit. They stripped away information about the speaker when deciding whether to accept, preventing personal friendship, animosity, or bigotry from influencing their decision.\nFree expression arguably came in at the stage where a bunch of communists, SJWs, and their fellow travelers demanded that Yarvin be excluded, demands which were usually accompanied by flinging a lot of insults tangentially related to what he&#8217;d written elsewhere under the handle Moldbug. (Particularly hilarious and stupid were the variations on &#8216;white supremacist&#8217; and &#8216;Nazi&#8217;: Moldbug is a Jew who praises Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong.) This sort of shitflinging attempt to get a speaker removed because he allegedly said wicked things elsewhere is opposed to free expression: it implies that you can&#8217;t talk about programming if you have talked about reactionary politics. It is further and more dangerously opposed to free expression when seen in context of recent scalps such as Brendan Eich, which suggests there is a wider stream of opinion that you should lose your livelihood if you expressed support for the former party line and haven&#8217;t loudly and vehemently enough recanted and wavered with the party.\nInclusion was why LambdaConf told the above lot to bugger off. I won&#8217;t repeat here what they said at great length elsewhere.\nSafety needs a disambiguation thanks to word-butchers fighting with rhetorical sleight of hand. One is what I will unashamedly call safety proper, which is where LambdaConf asks Moldbug if he will refrain from violence, and says they&#8217;ll exclude people with a history of violence or of breaking codes of conduct. The other is safety of feelings, which certain dishonest cry-bullies use as a way of suppressing dissent by saying that they don&#8217;t feel safe around persons of contrary opinion, therefore please exclude those persons.\n&#8212;\nTwo, the status of various communists as being communists is relevant because they started that aspect of the fight: among the arguments given for removing Yarvin from LambdaConf in specific and technical conferences in general were several variations on &#8220;He&#8217;s affiliated with/argues for/defends horrible, terrible, evil ideologies that murdered, enslaved and oppressed people!&#8221; (Shorter version: &#8220;He&#8217;s a fascist!&#8221;) But these are grounds for removing every communist too; and arguably removing the communists first because of communism&#8217;s bloodier history and the communists&#8217; closer ties to specific bloody implementations, where Moldbug professes no loyalty to any existing ideological structure and has several times proposed new names (such as neocameralism) for the thing he&#8217;s building. However, the communists seem somewhat less than willing to have themselves excluded from technical conferences on these grounds, and their fellow-travelers similarly unwilling to disassociate.\nSummarised in logical form: The SJWs asserted X. X implies Y. The SJWs deny Y. This is a contradiction exposed by raising the matter of communism.\n&#8212;\nThree, on communism being bad and arguments thereto. &#8220;Solzhenitsyn&#8221; is a metonym much like one says &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; for the American film industry. It denotes in part Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, author of The Gulag Archipelago, a book on the gulags (prison-cum-slave-labor-cum-concentration-camps) of the totalitarian Soviet Union and the conditions therein; and denotes in part (information about) the gulags themselves. Over 10 million people passed through these, with very high mortality rates due to the gulag conditions being about as terrible as one might expect when imagining forced labor in Siberia. At least 1 million died there. The exact numbers are unknown and very hard to know, because, well, care for prisoners was in about as short supply as one might expect from the sort of people who will work prisoners to death in Siberia. Prisoners on the brink of death might frequently be given &#8220;amnesty&#8221; and set free (i.e. released into the Siberian wilderness while sick and malnourished) to fudge the statistics on prisoner death rate. I have seen estimates of 20 million people passing through the camps of which about half died and half escaped, but I think the minimal confirmed figures are enough to put this among the worst things in the world.\nThat&#8217;s still not counting the millions of other deaths from the Soviet Union outside of the gulag, or the millions of other deaths from communist regimes outside of the Soviet Union.\nWhile American does not have a month dedicated to remembering the abuses of communism the way it has a month dedicated to remembering the abuses of American slavery, the former are nonetheless monstrous enough to be at least comparable with the latter and well documented enough that you can expect to have abuse heaped on you if you try to brush them off.\n&#8212;\nFour, it is absolutely absurd to assert that ESR is a SJW or a warrior for the establishment, because ESR is an anarchist-libertarian-ish type, a pagan, a splitter, a Heinleinian, otherwise a fringe and contrarian sort of person in general, and has written so much anti-establishment material that it goes beyond mere ignorance and into knee-jerk &#8220;disagreement is fascist!&#8221; to assert such a thing.\n&#8212;\nFive, the argumentum ad hominem fallacy consists in attempting to reason from an insult to a conclusion that does not follow &#8211; for example, &#8220;You&#8217;re an asshat, therefore you are wrong.&#8221; There is no such fallacy in saying &#8220;You&#8217;re a mendacious turd, and you are wrong.&#8221; Fallacies are a bestiary of flaws in reasoning, not in conduct &#8211; if your interlocutor is telling you to take a long walk off a short pier, the correct response is not to cry fallacy, but to ask (yourself or your interlocutor) what you might have done to get such abuse.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1702380', 'CapitalistRoader', '2016-04-04T10:20:58+00:00', '1"', ' I understand many people in Russian today (and this explains Putin’s appeal I suppose), long for the time they were a part of the USSR because they feel like they had it better off then than now.\nHow do you understand this?

I&#8217;ve tried and failed to come up with a better synopsis than the product description on its Amazon page:\nGet in a queue with your family in front of a store and experience a rush of genuine emotions! The board game Kolejka (a.k.a. Queue) tells a story of everyday life in Poland at the tail-end of the Communist era. The players&#8217; task appears to be simple: They have to send their family members out to various stores on the game board to buy all the items on their shopping list. The problem is, however, that the shelves in the five neighborhood stores are empty. The players line up their pawns in front of the shops without knowing which shop will have a delivery. Tension mounts as the product delivery cards are uncovered and it turns out that there will be enough product cards only for the lucky few standing closest to the door of a store. Since everyone wants to be first, the queue starts to push up against the door. To get ahead, the people in the queue use a range of queuing cards, such as &#8216;Mother carrying small child&#8217;, &#8216;This is not your place, sir&#8217;, or &#8216;Under-the-counter goods&#8217;. But they have to watch out for &#8216;Closed for stocktaking&#8217;, &#8216;Delivery error&#8217;, and for the black pawns the speculators standing in the queue. Only those players who make the best use of the queuing cards in their hand will come home with full shopping bags. On the product cards are photos of sixty original objects from the Communist era. The merchandise includes Relaks shoes, Przemysawka eau de cologne, and Popularna tea, as well as other commodities that were once in scarce supply. The neighborhood also has an outdoor market but the prices there are steep unless, of course, you manage to strike a deal with the market trader. In this realistic game you really have to be savvy to get the goods. Are you brave enough to confront the everyday life of the 1980s?\nI posted this to my Facebook page.

We have an instruction set of 11 instructions, 5 of which are reducible to the first 6 &#8211; that&#8217;s less than a PDP-8&#8217;s 8, if you ignore the ones that are macros. Of course, a combinator-reducing machine is extremely different from a register machine. Our basic instructions are things like &#8220;get this from &#8216;memory&#8217; (as a combinator-reducing machine, our &#8216;memory&#8217; is semantically a big parameter passed around as needed, the &#8216;subject&#8217;)&#8221;, &#8220;test equality&#8221;, and &#8220;arithmetic (actually just the successor function)&#8221;; the macros are things like &#8220;if-then-else&#8221; and a &#8220;calling convention&#8221; that gets a Nock formula off the subject and computes it.\nThe Nock implementation at present (there&#8217;s work on opportunistically JIT-compiling hotspots in progress) is just a naive substitutional interpreter that follows the Nock reduction rules exactly as specified. But Nock-as-specified is only meant to prescribe semantics, not execution strategy. As long as your interpreter gets the right result, it&#8217;s a correct interpreter. So, even though our only arithmetic operation is increment, we have an O(1) add, because when the standard library add function, a known formula, is reached by the interpreter, the interpreter just calls mpz_add on the arguments. (We use GMP internally.) This is helped along by one of Nock&#8217;s instructions being a hint instruction that semantically does nothing. We do get away with &#8220;just&#8221; reference counting, plus an allocator that can create entire sub-memories that are entirely discarded when their creator is finished, but Rust semantics would be better still.\nS-expressions are *heinously complicated* compared to Nock nouns, which are either natural numbers or pairs of nouns.

Form your own  theories about any hot topic, from race to sexual orientation, as you will. This freedom is extremely intellectually stimulating and draws a lot of smart people. It also draws a lot of idiotic, evil nazis. Ouch. You can try to shut them out and say X, Y, Z is beyond the pale but then you just created a similar thought police as liberals and cuckservatives did, and this predictably results in the same kind of signalling arms-races: trying to look good through crapping on the vile, vile heretics. Thus, freedom of thought and ultimately truth suffers. How can you solve this dilemma? Find a good coordination point. The coordination point isn&#8217;t even MM, he is just the finger pointing to the Moon, the Moon i.e. Schelling point is/are old writers like Froude. Basically the idea seems to be that engage in any kind of crimethink but if Froude or such writers would consider your thoughts idiotic or evil, you stop and feel ashamed. I think that is the core concept. This way you need no set limits and yet avoid going down the kinds of rabbit holes that turn one into a nazi, which can otherwise happen even with very smart people (thinking Carl Schmidt here as an example). A good orientation, coordination point saves you from that while allowing you to doubt any modern idea, and the  Froude type old writers MM rediscovered are useful for that.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1702717', 'TheDividualist', '2016-04-05T11:43:22+00:00', '1"', '&gt;BTW, at least one Twitterer is saying Eric’s a neoreactionary…\nThe sine qua non for that is coming out against democracy and Eric I think never did that. The absolutely core NRx insight is that manipulation or media bias aren&#8217;t bugs in the system: as far as the two premises are true that it is always elites that rule (Gaetano Mosca) and that in the democracy they need the people&#8217;s consent for that, they pretty much ARE the system, absolutely core features. You cannot have elite rule and popular consent without elites manufacturing that consent. It&#8217;s not a bug but it&#8217;s whole point, it would be a logical contradiction to have elite rule in a popular-consent system (democracy) without the elite having a very firm control on the opinion of the people. Thus when you catch journalist lying, it is not a bug, it is the system functioning as intended. Since removing elitism is not possible, genetics and coordination problems and all, the only possible change is removing the requirement for popular consent in government, and that is anti-democratic.

AnCap simply means taking the slider with &#8220;size of the sovereign entity&#8221; and moving it all the way down: your sovereign state, estate is now the household. Or a farm. Or a corporation. Sovereignty as such is conserved, i.e. the total sum for the potential for coercion is conserved: property owners act as a government on their property, making and enforcing rules. The primary difference is that with small (e)states it is easy to get off someone&#8217;s lawn and be on your own, or choose a nicer landlord. This is what Nick Land summarizes, with the Hirschmannian terminology, as &#8220;exit over voice&#8221;. Nevertheless there is no denying that the small states in AnCap do have governments and those governments are much like a monarchy or dictatorship. The market process of competing for rent-paying tenants (aka taxpayers) or employees ensures that that sovereignty will not be abused, the potential for coercion will be very, very much under-exercised. It&#8217;s like this blog, you have the banhammer but it is not in your interest to use it in all but the most extreme cases. It is not the total sum of potential coercion or sovereignty that is reduced in AnCap but its actual exercise. And this is actually something NRx fully recognizes. \nThe interesting thing is that AnCap does not even automatically guarantee small state sizes. Anna Creek is larger than Scotland. What would it be under AnCap? Something pretty close to a monarchical state? \nWhile NRx recognizes the idea of turning the slider of sovereign entity size down, like city-states, it tends to focus more on the private property aspect (monarchy) than the market process aspect (small estates, competing for taxpayers/rent-paying tenant) , like how historic monarchies, despite their large size, were arguably better than modern democracies. But the line if of thinking is very similar to AnCap as long as you accept that Anna Creek or your house or the greengrocer shop at the corner under AnCap does have a government: the owner, with full rights to coerce i.e. make and enforce rules on its sovereign territory.\nBTW did anyone figure out whether in economics it is the private property aspect or the market process aspect that matters more? Like, what happens more often, people wash their cars just because it is theirs and like to have it nice i.e. the property aspect, or wash it because they want to sell it and expect a higher price that way i.e. the financial reward of the market process? I tend to lean towards more property aspect than market aspect, but it is arguable. Clearly both matters but I am of a family tradition where it is a matter of honor/shame to look after everything you own without even thinking about selling it or without even getting any financial rewards, income out of it. This is why I tend to favor states that are owned. I think democracy leads to socialism because it is an already socialist ownership of the government, the state itself. But then again it is possible that for most people the financial rewards of the market process matter more.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1703011', 'TheDividualist', '2016-04-06T03:47:52+00:00', '1"', '@James Donald the joint stock corporation is actually not an uncontroversial concept.

Galaxies can issue 16-bit &#8220;stars&#8221;, 256 through 65535 &#8211; for example, galaxy 0x50 can issue the stars 0x0150, 0x0250, etc. (Urbit is committed to little-endianness &#8211; your low bits identify your parentage.) The same applies to stars issuing 32-bit &#8220;planets&#8221;, and planets issuing 64-bit &#8220;moons&#8221;.\nNormally your name is a phonetic string, not a number &#8211; the phonetic system is just a base-65536 system made from gluing together two base-256 systems, except that the &#8220;planet space&#8221; is scrambled with a fixed pseudorandom permutation so that you can&#8217;t know someone&#8217;s parentage without taking the two seconds to type the line of code in your REPL that gives it. (Parentage isn&#8217;t secret, the scrambling is to stop you from subconsciously forming associations &#8211; humans are pattern-matchers.)\nBut the hierarchy does only two things: it signs your initial will (public key and other identity metadata), and routes you to other nodes on the network (but in the full design, you have exit rights and can use the routing services of any star or galaxy if they&#8217;ll take you). The point of Urbit is to *end* digital serfdom, poorly-informed blogposts on the Internet nonwithstanding.\nAn Urbit instance is always a full citizen of the Urbit network, just like a Unix box with a TCP/IP stack, no NAT restrictions, etc. is a full citizen of the IP network. The difference is that you don&#8217;t have to be a fortified tower run by professional system administrators to run an Urbit instance. We speak obligate-encrypted strongly-typed messages to each other on the Urbit network, and we will also operate various HTTP-based APIs for you in a strongly-typed way, as a concession to the existence of the legacy Internet. :)\nSo, while you can easily build Twitter on Urbit, for example (we have a serviceable IRC-clone, talk, that we use to chat on, which is easily bent to uses such as read-only broadcasting), that has a serious network effect. So instead we let you get an API key from Twitter, hold it for you, and control your Twitter stream as though it were a strongly-typed Urbit service. You know how most programmer-hours in the world are spent serializing, deserializing, and parsing data from one format to another? (That&#8217;s my personal assertion, which is completely unsupported by hard data, but probably true &#8211; hard data welcome.) Arvo (the OS layer of Urbit) is fully equipped to handle this transparently for you.\nWe use &#8220;marks&#8221;, which are code snippets where you provide things like validating parsers, serializers, and the like, as well as diff and patch algorithms (for example, the txt mark provides the standard text diff facilities, which most text-like marks just use unmodified, but we can easily provide meaningful binary diffs if the binary blob has a structure that we can exploit). The build engine, ford (this is one of the four-letter names that has a memorable etymology &#8211; our &#8220;assembly line&#8221; is named after Henry Ford), handles all requests for resources &#8211; so if you try to access a Markdown file in the filesystem (which is fully marked (and revision-controlled!)) from a web frontend that wants to display HTML, ford will use the &#8216;md&#8217; mark&#8217;s conversion to HTML, which is a Markdown renderer. (I&#8217;m no Markdown fan, but Curtis is.) It&#8217;s a system facility &#8211; no frontend ever needs to do rendering work.\nI certainly don&#8217;t have any interest in marketing Urbit to ESR through his blog comments &#8211; for one, I think Urbit needs less (and better) marketing, not more. For another thing, it falls well within his interests (network-infrastructure guy, but also enemy of SJWs) anyway &#8211; he&#8217;ll definitely get around to it either when he has enough spare time and curiosity, or when the project is more mature (or we&#8217;re better at explaining how mature it currently is). My job is to work on the latter.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1703073', 'bilbophile', '2016-04-06T07:14:26+00:00', '1"', 'A little late to the party, but hey&#8230; I am from a communist European country and spent almost half of my life in Communism. My immediate relatives were not in gulags and a few (including my father, in a very idiosyncratic way) were communists themselves; however, we all had to live under the abnormal, dehumanizing conditions of the communist rule. I am stating this for the record, although it is completely irrelevant for the point I am trying to make.\nI believe there is only one fundamental political alternative: there is the individualistic (classical-liberal/libertarian) funnel and the collectivist (socialist, fascist, theocratic etc.) funnel. Individualists claim that since we each have a soul/consciousness, our societies are systems of autonomous entities and we should assist each other in protecting our lives, liberty and right to seek our happiness our own way. Collectivists perceive society as an organic whole and insist on helping everybody else in reaching their proper place in society, according to their merit.\nThe starting points at the large end of each funnel may be different but if one follows one option consistently, the end result is the same. Because positive coercion is always an option (which gets more attractive the freer and richer a community is), nobody can go all the way down the individualistic path, but all the communities that went far enough in that direction created a society with flaws and injustices, but efficient, dynamic and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; continuously self-improving. The end of the collectivist path is always the same, whether the community is based on ethnicity, religion, race, or social condition(!!). I have read about Nazi Germany and &#8211; except for the racial identity of their scapegoats &#8211; they are a parody of Bolshevism with some Fascist elements thrown in for good measure. \nMore importantly, it seems that both Italian Fascism (originally not antisemitic) and German National Socialism exhausted the economic resources of their countries by gradually subordinating free enterprise to the political &#8220;needs&#8221; of the nation. Allegedly, had the German Reich survived until 1945-1946, it would have been as broke as USSR without the Land-Lease from the US, with highly inefficient enterprises in the occupied territories (that was the reason for snatching workers from the occupied countries to Germany), and with all the relevant enterprises under the direct or indirect control of the central planners. Keeping in mind that on the other hand, at the time of his death, Stalin was planning the deportation and the decimation of the Soviet Jews, the difference between the USSR and Nazi Germany seem to be only in the path taken toward the end result. \nLenin started with War Communism, made a detour through paternalistic capitalism (NEP) to avoid a total economic shutdown, and then Stalin reverted to a central command and control system to avoid either economic or political collapse. In Germany they started by misallocating resources via their budget, went on with credit and foreign currency controls to prevent bankruptcy, continued with government-issued YOUs and with government product allocations and orders, to end with government-run and/or government-planned enterprises. While Lenin thought that management had become routine to the point capitalists were redundant, to Hitler entrepreneurs were mere shop managers. \nIt may be that taken individually, the starvation-campaigns in Ukraine and the mass deportations and internments which ended only with Stalin&#8217;s death caused less deaths than the Nazi concentrations camps; still, on the whole their impact was broader, more pervasive and damaging on the communities as a whole.\nTo conclude, the Nazi policies and the Communist policies point in the same direction with one major but secondary detail: the Nazis started by appointing fixed scapegoats and used this diversion to gradually grab control over the rest society, while communists acted fast, in war conditions (they occasionally had to engineer themselves) and defined their scapegoats more opportunistically.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1703094', 'J.

The priesthood agreed amongst themselves what was good behavior and bad behavior, and judges and posse leaders were priests, or selected by priests. Everyone had the same race and religion, so tended to agree on what was right and what was wrong, and deviating from that religion was a crime. Not so good.\nHave you actually read the Book of Judges? The tribes may have had the concept of belonging to an overall “Israel”, but they allied with outsiders against each other quite regularly, and had enough linguistic variance for “shibboleth” to have the English meaning it does. As for religion, even discounting the cult of Micha (worshiping YHWH in a popular but unauthorized fashion), for much of the four centuries covered by Judges (and the next five centuries covered in Samuel and Kings, too) worship of the neighboring nations’ gods was so prevalent that Gideon (whose own name was theophoric with a non-Israelite cult) had to send away 30 regiments and went to war with a single company of 300 men. There’s a reason the author of the Book used the phrase “There was no king in Israel; everyone did what he thought was best,” where he did.\n(And for those who do not accept the historicity of Judges, that era is even less suitable as an example of JAD’s “successful anarchic societies”.)\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1703104', 'TheDividualist', '2016-04-06T09:13:28+00:00', '1"', '@bilbohpile individualism vs. collectivism is a good starting point for political philosophy, but it is not more than a starting point. I actually chose the dividualist nickname to signal some kind of a post-individualism. The starting is guilty of presentism &#8211; it may describe the 20th century, but not the 18th. And it seems to increasingly less well describe the 21st. One thing that is changing is that politics is becoming more personal &#8211; it is not about the government limiting free speech, for example, but individual pressure groups. The weirdest part of the whole SJW story is that it works like the older left-right political battles but instead of it being about what the government should do, it is about what individuals do. Another aspect is that the left side is increasingly using an individualistic terminology &#8211; instead of talking about a state as an organic unity, they talk about equalizing chances of individuals and an even playing field and privilege and all that, which conjures the image of every individual competing against every other individual and they simply find the rules unfair. This may just be propaganda and the end goal may still be grabbing governmental power, but still it is very noticable that old-style collectivism is not cool today. \nFor this reason, I think individualism and collectivism are not the root causes of the problems. It looks like the left used a collectivistic agenda when it seemed to be a handy way to grab power and status and abandoned much of it when it no longer looked like that. Individualism mostly meant the opposition needed a flag to rally around, too. But it is not the root cause.\nThe root cause is probably competition between various groups, for power, status, influence, respect. The &#8220;right&#8221; usually mean that the highest status groups were aristocrats, capitalists, priests, and military officers. A new intellectual and public servant class, you could say, &#8220;the nobility of the robe&#8221; or in the US the &#8220;new class&#8221; organized themselves to grab power and status from these traditional elites. They used various agendas, sometimes a religious difference, sometimes nationalism, sometimes collectivism, and sometimes a more individualistic language. Lenin or Bukharin were clearly intellectuals and even Stalin had to pretend to. Today the transfat otherkin SJW whining about hostile work environments don&#8217;t come across as particularly collectivist &#8211; they seem to claim that it is about competition between individuals with unfair rules, and they tend to use direct pressure, not the hand of the government. But there is one thing common in them, they are, in a way, intellectuals, they often come from good universities, they use complicated words like intersectionalism and so on. It&#8217;s all about rule by intellectuals through ideology and holiness-signalling. Collectivism was just a handy ideological excuse for that, but there are other ones.\nIt is especially clear in Post-Communist Europe where ex-Communists, often with a generous helping from the Soros types, reinvented themselves as individualists. But it is just an excuse, they steal a factory, sell it to their friends, put the money in an offshore account and then tell people it was privatized because the market is more efficient. But it is just an excuse.\nAnother very clear example is the concept of human rights. They are a highly intellectual project and is very clearly about intellectuals grabbing power, because normal people care about whether humans are violated or not, not human rights. Deciding whether an act is evil based on a written list is extremely dweeby. &#8220;Beaten, raped, and murdered? Let&#8217;s see, yes, item 11, 16, 19 in this list say that is wrong.&#8221; So human rights fetishism is a textbook intellectual-power thing. Are human rights individualistic or collectivistic? Well negative rights are individualistic and positive rights are collectivistic. But who cares? They just use whatever is handy for them. If a right-wing government of the Pinochet type kicks their ass, they complain about negative rights, if they are the government, they use positive rights as an excuse for moar government. So don&#8217;t fall for it.

While I&#8217;m not going to make an extended analogy about debate and war (which would really be over-explaining Clausewitz&#8217;s famous quote), the two aspects of the philosophy of war which apply here are discrimination and proportionality [contexually: don&#8217;t deliberately target civilians, and don&#8217;t use &#8220;excessive force&#8221;]. De-platforming (or, like with Brendan Eich, attacks against employment) are neither sufficiently targeted toward changing one opinion, nor measured to prevent &#8216;collateral damage&#8217; to would-be allies.

For example, suppose a skilled widget-painter does twice the work of a poor one, whether in quality or quantity, and gets remunerated correspondingly.

The dictionary definition means worker control of the means of production. So basically a government that would confiscate shares from shareholders and give it to workers of the firm would be 100% socialist, even if it does not do any of the following things: taxation, providing social services, unemployment benefits, old age pensions, healthcare, education spending, poverty relief, social housing and you name it.\nThe dictionary definition of socialism simply does not require all that. It requires one move &#8211; although that is arguably fairly lethal &#8211; and that move could be done with a very small number of government employees and hardly any spending. Bakunin argued that even just replacing permanent property rights with impermanent usage rights may just do the trick. I think these are all extremely bad ideas and would lead to people killing each other in no time but that is not the point.\nMy point is simply to demonstrate that socialism is nothing but an excuse. Nobody is a socialist. Nobody who matters. What actually happened all through history  that influential people figured out it would be in their interest to, for example, lead an organization that provides poverty relief or state-paid education. They needed an excuse. What was their excuse? They claimed that capitalism is unfair on the poor. And they used socialist ideology as reason why. \nNobody ever really cares about socialism, it is largely bullshit. It is almost a joke. If actual workers would own the productive resources they would sell them for whiskey. Thy are usually stupid. Does anyone who ever worked with blue collars would give them a factory? Have you seen how they treat company cars? Besides, it is intellectuals who advocate socialism, not workers. How the eff would actual socialism benefit them? It would be worker control, not intellectual control. So it has never ever been meant seriously.  But a socialist critique of capitalism is and has always been used as an excuse to gain status, power, or holiness points largely through an expansion of government. By intellectuals, by bureaucrats.\nTry to see through these excuses, please, both sides. The really, truly important thing is that simply socialism is used as a handy to excuse to charge capitalism with being unfair and thus grant one a cozy government job to fix an aspect of unfairness. Hardly anyone ever cared about actually trying to give productive resources to workers because it is a bad idea anyway but the important part is: how would that benefit the upper middle class, Harvard educated, socially ambitious Beltway bureaucrat? Or his European or Russian counterpart? Because that is what really mattered. And matters. Thus let&#8217;s not even take this term seriously.\n&#8220;Socialism&#8221; essentially just means this. Be a smart intellectual. Find the dumbest group of people you can. They will, naturally, not have an easy life. Furiously preach how their rights or interests are violated. Make them support you with votes and street violence. Then, don&#8217;t actually do the simple, straightforward amendments that directly adress the very (perceived) injustices you raised awareness to (Bakunin&#8217;s impermanent property rights as a form of actual socialism, or shares to workers or something in this example), partially because they are obviously bad ideas and partially because that would not give you status or power. Instead, demand creating an agency, a social program under your control that merely addresses various **effects** of the perceived injustice. Like, workers not controlling the means of production leads to accidents as evil capitalists disregard the safety rules? Now you get to run the OSHA and write a million safety rules. Like, workers not controlling the means of production leads to unemployment? Now you run the dole office. And so on. This trick is old and people keep falling for it.

The sources Winter helpfully provided (but didn&#8217;t apparently read all the way through) include the following paragraph on how the word socialism is used:\n&#8220;In the many years since socialism entered English around 1830, it has acquired several different meanings. It refers to a system of social organization in which private property and the distribution of income are subject to social control, but the conception of that control has varied, and the term has been interpreted in widely diverging ways, ranging from statist to libertarian, from Marxist to liberal. In the modern era, “pure” socialism has been seen only rarely and usually briefly in a few Communist regimes. Far more common are systems of social democracy, now often referred to as “democratic socialism,” in which extensive state regulation, with limited state ownership, has been employed by democratically elected governments (as in Sweden and Denmark) in the belief that it produces a fair distribution of income without impairing economic growth.&#8221;\nWhat&#8217;s more important is that it doesn&#8217;t matter that we can&#8217;t decide on an objective definition.

We barely even notice things like the attempted coup in Venezuela in 2003.\nThey&#8217;re not in the news because the &#8216;social Democrat&#8217; socialists that tell the news don&#8217;t want to be embarrassed by their prior support of a couple of socialist dictators.  Those that pay attention to the world, economics, and politics, meanwhile, have been pointing out how bad things are in Zimbabwe and have been getting in Venezuela for years, but the people trying to bring the same policies here don&#8217;t listen.  Then there&#8217;s the recent Panama Papers: records cronies of socialists (of both the dictator and the democrat types) stashing their cash.\nHey, don’t knock Cuban health care. First country in the world to eradicate polio.  \nAnd that and the 100% literacy rate really feels good to those languishing in prison for thought crimes, or those willing to risk their lives to escape.\nWell, look at the other differences between Venezuela and Saudi Arabia:\nFree press? Venezuela has one, Saudi Arabia doesn’t.\nFreedom of religion? Venezuelans are mostly Catholic, yes, but there are no laws about that sort of thing. Saudis must be Sunni Muslim on penalty of death, even the 25% that are Shi’a and the odd Christian.\nFree elections? It actually does seem like Maduro is that popular (at the very least, Chavez was saved in the 2003 attempted coup by the people), while Saudi Arabia has no free elections.\nWell, considering the Venezuelan government repression of the press and the opposition, &#8216;free elections&#8217; and &#8216;free press&#8217; are lies.  And even so, Saudi Arabia has shelves stocked with food and toilet paper and basic human needs available to the common people, unlike Venezuela.  I thought Socialism was supposed to prevent people from starving to death?  Like Stalin, like Mugabe, like Marduro&#8230;\nAlso, my point about Pfc. Manning and Mr. Snowden was that they showed us that a good chunk of the government could not be trusted. I honestly think we should fire 80-99 percent of the CIA and NSA. (We also should change our rules about handling classified information. Someone at DOD can actually get fired for checking Wikileaks – because they /don’t have clearance/ to see classified stuff – even though it’s already public knowledge.)\nThey showed us the State Department and DoD (and their foreign counterparts) occasionally act diplomatic, which was a real surprise.  There&#8217;s a reason security classifications and rules are the way they are.\nIn any case, I’m definitely voting for Clinton in November, and the only thing that’ll stop me is if she loses the primary (which is unlikely, but I still voted/am voting/will vote (absentee ballot, not yet sent in) for Sanders). Trump, I think we can all agree, would be a horrible president, and Cruz is not much better. Kasich is better than both, but still, to me, worse than Clinton.\nWow, a socialist voting for a rich career politician whose made tons of money from Wall Street and sold the influence of her position to rich foreigners, is responsible for catastrophic fiascos in Syria and Libya, covered up multiple rapes and trashed a rape accuser, believes the laws don&#8217;t apply to her and other top men, and wants to trash the first amendment?  I&#8217;d say I was surprised, but that would be a lie; seems par for the course.  At this point, the Republicans would practically have to run Stalin&#8217;s reanimated corpse to get me to vote for her (leaving aside the unlikelyhood of voting for Trump).  At least Sanders, crazy and out of it though he may be, has standards and human decency.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1704922', 'Jay Maynard', '2016-04-11T18:37:38+00:00', '1"', 'EMF: &#8220;No, they don’t think it’ll work in the US because Americans have a pathological fear of government (not that it’s unjustified, as Pfc.

In that light, questions about when or if messages were classified are utterly irrelevant, and concerns about how she handled the events in Benghazi are only tangential to the true issue. \nFurthermore, this is (to me at least) also the most critical question to ask of any presidential candidate: when facing any sort of oversight/restraint, how will they respond?

However, they really want to be able to use it if they need to, and to ensure that it will be around, they are willing to pay a total of $Z. In other words, the continued existence of the train is worth $Z to them, but they don&#8217;t need it all that much in everyday life, and only pay $X in train fare. The minimal revenues needed to ensure that the train will continue stopping at that town is $Y, and $X &lt; $Y  For starters, you would need information about everyone’s economic priorities, to a higher resolution than they would have. Any less, and enough of people will demonstrate that shortcoming to delegitimize the notion that your plan will make everyone better off.

The problem is that if you say Orwell was in Spain because he was a bad socialist, then it seems like you might have to say that the ILP sent him because they were a whole party of bad socialists, and that raises the question of whether maybe the entire British socialist left contemporary to Hitler were also bad socialists &#8212; or was it roughly half?  25%?\nI mean I literally don&#8217;t know whether or not you are saying Orwell was individually exceptional in this regard &#8212; even after your second reply to me.\nContrary to what was suggested (not by you), I&#8217;m not &#8220;trolling&#8221; here.  I&#8217;m not trying to argue, or even to put forward my own perspective.\nRather, I literally don&#8217;t understand what position is being taken by others, and I&#8217;m trying to understand how another world view (which I can at least tell differs from mine) conceives of things.\nOne thing I know for sure is that I can&#8217;t predict who will be called a socialist in this thread.  Franco is now being called a socialist (though again not by you).  It makes me wonder if Curtis/Moldbug is a socialist too!  This is not snark, I literally do not know how I would go predicting this or how the other thought system makes this distinction.\nIt seems people have become so hardened by polemic and snark that I can&#8217;t ask a simple question without it being interpreted as some kind of attack.  Right?  Just to get somebody to explain, &#8220;OK, this is what I think: X, Y, and Z.&#8221; &#8212; it seems one can&#8217;t do that very easily about some topics.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1705288', 'esr', '2016-04-13T04:43:12+00:00', '1"', 'Well, I don’t claim to know how you operate, or to know a lot about the Spanish Civil War. I just read Homage to Catalonia and some relevant wiki pages. (And the first half of For Whom the Bell Tolls.)\nOK, you&#8217;ve read biography, I&#8217;ve read history.  Though I will note that within certain limits imposed by his own idealism Orwell was a pretty shrewd observer; I&#8217;d take his biography over some of the frothier histories I&#8217;ve read. \nTo attempt to answer your question: no, I don&#8217;t think Orwell was unique.  I don&#8217;t think he, or the ILP, or certain parts of the British left executed the moral premises and doctrine of socialism very correctly. And I think this is a good thing.  Those premises did make them vulnerable to being used by Soviet totalitarianism, which almost happened to Orwell quite directly &#8211; had the leader of the British Communist party not considered him unreliable (e.g. a bad socialist) Orwell admits he would have joined the Soviet-run International Brigades.\nI literally do not know how I would go predicting this or how the other thought system makes this distinction.\nThe essence of socialism is treating individual human beings as means to the end of the social collective, rather than autonomous ends in themselves. Socialism is the conscious opposite of individualism. This was true even in pre-Marxian utopian socialisms like Fourierism, but acquired a much sharper and deadlier edge in Communism and (Germano/Italian) Fascism.\nWith that, perhaps it is now understandable what I mean when I say Orwell was a bad socialist.  To his credit, he retained a bedrock conviction that the dignity and happiness of individual humans is important; he never reduced them to units to be social-engineered into conformity on the road to the glorious future of the collective.\nI think Franco never quite went there, ideologically; as I&#8217;ve written before, he seemed to view himself as a conservative defender of the pre-1933 Spanish order and never had the tastes or the temperament of a genuine tyrant. His body count was certainly multiple orders of magnitude smaller than Hitler or Stalin racked up.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1705276', 'afc', '2016-04-13T04:02:43+00:00', '1"', 'esr: they may have believed and professed many of the same things, but they did not profess that they believed the same things as each other.

They also look unfriendly and uncomradely, they divide us.  Let us therefore abolish them&#8221;\nAnd then the socialist, attempting to produce a pencil, produces instead many miles of red tape and a severe pencil shortage.\nThe fences and the dogs serve a purpose, that purpose being to subdivide big problems into subproblems small enough to be manageable.\nLibertarianism works provided you have fences, and often enough you also need rentacops and vicious junk yard dogs to make libertarianism work.  And it is the only thing that does work to make a modern economy function &#8211; apart from terror and mass murder, and terror and mass murder does not work nearly as well as libertarianism and fences.\nLibertarianism does not work where you do not have fences.  Public transport in America fails because of blacks.  To make it work again, you really are going to have to send blacks to the back of the bus.  Whites just will not ride buses with significant black ridership, for excellent and glaringly obvious reasons that no one dares mention.  You wanted integrated buses, got buses with no white ridership.\nSimilarly &#8220;integration&#8221; was in practice the dispossession and ethnic cleansing of whites in the inner city and Detroit.\nIf you have blacks and whites in the same classroom, the blacks are very much louder, take up more space, and are dangerous and threatening, disrupting education and forcing the white kids into submissive roles.\nFurther, the kind of discipline required to make it possible for blacks to learn in a classroom is a lot more severe than the kind of discipline required to make it possible for whites to learn in a classroom.  Few blacks are capable of learning without being whipped.\nAnd of course, at a certain age, the blacks are into, or have completed puberty, and the black pupils are man sized and able to beat up the teacher, while the whites have not begun puberty, or have scarcely begun it, and are still child sized and still behave like children.\nAnd if you have twelve year old white boys and twelve year old white girls in the same classroom, the twelve year old girls are well and truly into puberty, and the twelve year old boys are not, creating a profoundly disruptive environment, though not as severe as that caused by twelve year old white boys, and twelve year old black adult men in the same classroom.\nBut the biggest failure of libertarianism, the biggest failure by far, is marriage and the family.  Libertarianism is basically incompatible with family formation, children, and grandchildren, with the continued existence of whites and east Asians, for white and east Asian women are psychologically incapable of breeding near replacement in a libertarian environment.\nThe problem is that for a man and a woman to raise their children together, to provide their children with a mother and a father, they have to form one household, no fences.  But if one household, then one captain.  The man has to be boss.  Further, they have to be stuck with each other for incentive compatibility. Consent to sex has to be once and forever. If consent to sex is moment to moment, then marriage is moment to moment, and you get serial monogamy, which means that husbands have no incentive to care for and nurture their wives, and wives no incentive to please and obey their husbands.  Which means that women get their way sexually until they hit a certain age and become cat ladies, and men do not get their way sexually, and means that children have only one parent, and a lengthy succession of violent and abusive step parents.\nA libertarian solution to marriage and the family would mean two separate households with visitation rights.  A lot of people are trying that today, and it is not working.  This stuff just fails.  Broken families, empty buses, hellish schools.  Esr will call me a horrible racist.  Go ride a bus, esr.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1705285', 'James Donald', '2016-04-13T04:39:43+00:00', '1"', '&gt; Rather, I literally don’t understand what position is being taken by others, and I’m trying to understand how another world view (which I can at least tell differs from mine) conceives of things.\nTrouble is you are not reading works from that world view.\nHayek is probably a little long winded for your taste.

However, I can understand the state wanting to maintain its competitive advantage in attracting jobs, and have seen the bad press caused by New York and California.  A city raising it&#8217;s minimum wage could be interpreted by businesses that only see quick media coverage as the state increasing it&#8217;s minimum wage.\nThe problem is that in order to influence the bill, you need to accept that the resulting bill will be a compromise.

However, they really want to be able to use it if they need to, and to ensure that it will be around, they are willing to pay a total of $Z. In other words, the continued existence of the train is worth $Z to them, but they don&#8217;t need it all that much in everyday life, and only pay $X in train fare. The minimal revenues needed to ensure that the train will continue stopping at that town is $Y, and $X is less than $Y.\nFirst off, this scenario as described is incomplete. Is $Z greater than $Y/(number of individuals)? Or less?\nIf it is greater, then all you would have to do is present the above case to the public as a risk management opportunity. The risk each individual faces of really needing a train is managed by paying a total insurance cost of $Y (per unit time), divided by the number of individuals with that risk. Since that quotient is less than $Z, the amount each person is willing to pay to keep the station, everyone agrees to pay it. At no time was socialism necessary.\nIf it is less, then the above scenario requires everyone to pay more to keep the station than they are willing, and so they let the station shut down, and spend their $Z on whatever else they prefer. At no time was socialism necessary, and in fact, if it were in place, it would force all of them to spend their money suboptimally.\nEven the former case is only possible when the scenario is &#8220;clear cut&#8221;. To allude to your first point, consider the more realistic case: $X is known, but $Y and $Z are unknown but contingent on several other factors of unknown magnitude, and there are N other alternatives on which to spend $Z, for which there also exist tuples of $X_i and $Y_i, likewise either known or contingent upon several factors of unknown magnitude.\nPaul Brinkley wrote: For starters, you would need information about everyone&#8217;s economic priorities, to a higher resolution than they would have.

Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all “progressive” thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don’t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarized version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people “I offer you a good time,” Hitler has said to them “I offer you struggle, danger and death,” and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1705435', 'Jorge Dujan', '2016-04-13T16:28:18+00:00', '1"', '@ esr\n&gt; Well, it is generally understood not to be, anyway.

We used to believe that the concept was totally without substance. Instead we see the nation arise as a palpitating reality before us! &#8230; Class cannot destroy the nation. Class reveals itself as a collection of interests—but the nation is a history of sentiments, traditions, language, culture, and race. Class can become an integral part of the nation, but the one cannot eclipse the other.[49]\nThe class struggle is a vain formula, without effect and consequence wherever one finds a people that has not integrated itself into its proper linguistic and racial confines—where the national problem has not been definitely resolved. In such circumstances the class movement finds itself impaired by an inauspicious historic climate.[50]\n\nThe way I interpret this is that Mussolini was professing to believe something different from socialism.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1705445', 'Paul Brinkley', '2016-04-13T17:23:48+00:00', '1"', 'Doctor Locketopus wrote: He is pretending that the atrocities of the Soviet Union didn’t exist, or don’t matter, or however you want to characterize his refusal to believe that they have any relevance to the issue.

What&#8217;s important to note, according to the very biography that was linked above, is that Mussolini wasn&#8217;t the only socialist to break with the party over this issue.\n&#8220;Mussolini continued to promote the need of a revolutionary vanguard elite to lead society. He no longer advocated a proletarian vanguard, but instead a vanguard led by dynamic and revolutionary people of any social class. Though he denounced orthodox socialism and class conflict, he maintained at the time that he was a nationalist socialist and a supporter of the legacy of nationalist socialists in Italy&#8217;s history, such as Giuseppe Garibaldi, Giuseppe Mazzini, and Carlo Pisacane.  As for the Italian Socialist Party and its support of orthodox socialism, he claimed that his failure as a member of the party to revitalize and transform it to recognize the contemporary reality revealed the hopelessness of orthodox socialism as outdated and a failure.  This perception of the failure of orthodox socialism in the light of the outbreak of World War I was not solely held by Mussolini, other pro-interventionist Italian socialists such as Filippo Corridoni and Sergio Panunzio had also denounced classical Marxism in favor of intervention.&#8221;\nFurther, the reasons he cited for becoming an interventionist were distinctly Socialist:\nHe eventually decided to declare support for the war by appealing to the need for socialists to overthrow the Hohenzollern and Habsburg monarchies in Germany and Austria-Hungary who he claimed had consistently repressed socialism. He further justified his position by denouncing the Central Powers for being reactionary powers; for pursuing imperialist designs against Belgium and Serbia as well as historically against Denmark, France, and against Italians, since hundreds of thousands of Italians were under Habsburg rule. He claimed that the fall of Hohenzollern and Habsburg monarchies and the repression of &#8220;reactionary&#8221; Turkey would create conditions beneficial for the working class. While he was supportive of the Entente powers, Mussolini responded to the conservative nature of Tsarist Russia by claiming that the mobilization required for the war would undermine Russia&#8217;s reactionary authoritarianism and the war would bring Russia to social revolution. He claimed that for Italy the war would complete the process of Risorgimento by uniting the Italians in Austria-Hungary into Italy and by allowing the common people of Italy to be participating members of the Italian nation in what would be Italy&#8217;s first national war. Thus he claimed that the vast social changes that the war could offer meant that it should be supported as a revolutionary war.&#8221;\nReading is fun and educational!\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1705454', 'afc', '2016-04-13T17:42:49+00:00', '1"', 'Civilis, the question being addressed was whether fascists *professed* to believe the same thing as socialists (and vice versa, although that part of the question does not seem to be disputed).\nOn that matter, the wiki page I quoted contains another Mussolini quote expressly disclaiming socialism and I followed up on the source, which comes from a document written by Mussolini called &#8220;THE DOCTRINE OF FASCISM&#8221; and this is the official translation into English:\nhttp://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm\nI didn&#8217;t bother quoting from it, but if you search for &#8220;sociali&#8221; within the document, there are 22 matches.

But in any case this is the best section to read:\nTHE FASCIST TOTALITARIAN VISION OF THE FUTURE\nThe Fascist negation of socialism, democracy, liberalism, should not, however, be interpreted as implying a desire to drive the world backwards to positions occupied prior to 1789, a year commonly referred to as that which opened the demo-liberal century. History does not travel backwards. The Fascist doctrine has not taken De Maistre as its prophet. Monarchical absolutism is of the past, and so is ecclesiolatry. Dead and done for are feudal privileges and the division of society into closed, uncommunicating castes. Neither has the Fascist conception of authority anything in common with that of a police ridden State.\nA party governing a nation “totalitarianly&#8221; is a new departure in history. There are no points of reference nor of comparison. From beneath the ruins of liberal, socialist, and democratic doctrines, Fascism extracts those elements which are still vital. It preserves what may be described as &#8220;the acquired facts&#8221; of history; it rejects all else. That is to say, it rejects the idea of a doctrine suited to all times and to all people. Granted that the XIXth century was the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy, this does not mean that the XXth century must also be the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy. Political doctrines pass; nations remain. We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the &#8221; right &#8220;, a Fascist century. If the XIXth century was the century of the individual (liberalism implies individualism) we are free to believe that this is the &#8220;collective&#8221; century, and therefore the century of the State.\nReading that was certainly informative to me.  This thread has definitely changed my understanding of fascism, or at least made it concrete and specific where it had been abstract and vague.  Actually, this part was even better:\nTHE ABSOLUTE PRIMACY OF THE STATE\nThe keystone of the Fascist doctrine is its conception of the State, of its essence, its functions, and its aims. For Fascism the State is absolute, individuals and groups relative. Individuals and groups are admissible in so far as they come within the State. Instead of directing the game and guiding the material and moral progress of the community, the liberal State restricts its activities to recording results. The Fascist State is wide awake and has a will of its own. For this reason it can be described as &#8221; ethical &#8220;.\nAt the first quinquennial assembly of the regime, in 1929, I said  “The Fascist State is not a night watchman, solicitous only of the personal safety of the citizens; not is it organized exclusively for the purpose of guarantying a certain degree of material prosperity and relatively peaceful conditions of life, a board of directors would do as much. Neither is it exclusively political, divorced from practical realities and holding itself aloof from the multifarious activities of the citizens and the nation. The State, as conceived and realized by Fascism, is a spiritual and ethical entity for securing the political, juridical, and economic organization of the nation, an organization which in its origin and growth is a manifestation of the spirit. The State guarantees the internal and external safety of the country, but it also safeguards and transmits the spirit of the people, elaborated down the ages in its language, its customs, its faith. The State is not only the present; it is also the past and above all the future. Transcending the individual&#8217;s brief spell of life, the State stands for the immanent conscience of the nation. The forms in which it finds expression change, but the need for it remains. The State educates the citizens to civism, makes them aware of their mission, urges them to unity; its justice harmonizes their divergent interests; it transmits to future generations the conquests of the mind in the fields of science, art, law, human solidarity; it leads men up from primitive tribal life to that highest manifestation of human power, imperial rule.\n(I chose to end that quote on a sentence which demonstrates unambiguously that there is a disagreement about fundamental goals rather than tactics, but the section goes on.)\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1705485', 'EMF', '2016-04-13T19:34:22+00:00', '1"', 'Also, I think I oughta put my 2¢ in on the original post.

It shows up in a lot of interesting places.. the Soviet army was the Workers and Peasants Red Army, for example.  Carry on a few decades and communist China is the People&#8217;s Republic of China, the nominal legislature for which is the National People&#8217;s Congress.  \nNow head back and re-read Mussolini (&#8220;No individuals or groups (political parties, cultural associations, economic unions, social classes) outside the State. Fascism is therefore opposed to Socialism to which unity within the State (which amalgamates classes into a single economic and ethical reality) is unknown, and which sees in history nothing but the class struggle.&#8220;).  Mussolini&#8217;s problem with Marxist socialism is that he felt the class warfare dynamic was no longer applicable, and that rather than a worker&#8217;s vanguard, a national vanguard formed from all classes would be required.  \nWe&#8217;re left with a pair of observations.  On the one hand, we can&#8217;t necessarily trust governments when they say what drives them because declared ideology itself is a form of propaganda, and thus governments will lie if it suits their needs.  On the other hand, seeing what governments claim to believe itself tells us something about the government, even if what they say is not true.  (Example: a government saying it is Democratic doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it&#8217;s a democracy, it does say that the government thinks democratic governments are more legitimate.)  Current socialist governments claim to represent not the workers, but the people as a whole, which indicates they base their claim to power not on the international working class, but on the nation as a whole.\nTrying to answer the question &#8216;why do the governments where socialists have power in practice look very much like the ones where fascists have power?&#8217;, we&#8217;ve gone from &#8216;fascists are, in fact, socialists&#8217; to &#8216;socialists (at least those in power) are, in fact, fascists&#8217;.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1705667', 'Civilis', '2016-04-14T09:12:56+00:00', '1"', 'For added fun (and I&#8217;m starting to worry that I&#8217;m having this much fun), compare what Mussolini said to these quotes:\n&#8220;Marxism–Leninism presented a series of opinions on building of Socialism and Communism, but it confined itself to presupposition and hypothesis owing to the limitations of the conditions of their ages and practical experiences &#8230; But many countries applied the principles of Marxist–Leninist materialistic conception of history dogmatically, failing to advance revolution continually after the establishment of the socialist system&#8221;\n&#8220;The political and ideological might of the motive force of revolution is nothing but the power of single-hearted unity between the leader, the Party, and the masses.

Take a definition for fruit, the product of a tree or other plant that contains seed and can be eaten as food.  We can take an apple, which we think is a fruit, cut it open, and see that it contains seeds.  We can take a potato, which we think is a vegetable, cut it open, and see that it does not contain seeds.  We can then take a tomato, commonly considered a vegetable, cut it open, see that it contains seeds.  We either have to modify our definition or change the classification of tomato.  Looking into it, there&#8217;s a difference between the biological definition and the culinary definition, which explains the difference.  We&#8217;re used to the culinary definition, but we can accept both definitions as situationally valid.  If someone is making a fruit salad, we can leave the tomato out; if someone has a fruit allergy, we want to be careful about giving them a tomato.\nLet&#8217;s take a look at your definitions for a second.\na system in which there is a social safety net in place:  It&#8217;s relatively easy to find examples of states with safety nets.  Is there a state that does not have a safety net in place?  (For the sake of making it easy to find out whether a given state has a safety net, let&#8217;s avoid states in the midst of civil war.  Often the reason those don&#8217;t seem to have safety nets is the government parts which run the programs aren&#8217;t working at all.)\na system in which there is a safety net in place, explicitly excluding a planned economy:\nBecause most states seem to have a safety net in place, it might be easier to list states with a planned economy as not being socialist.  Planned economy requires some definition.  First google link gives us &#8216;another term for command economy&#8217;; command economy gives us an economy in which production, investment, prices, and incomes are determined centrally by a government.\nIt should be obvious why this presents a problem.  While most of them seem to have liberalized somewhat, this describes most communist states at some point, all of which also describe themselves as socialist (as in Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).  Why are some people using a term in a way which seems completely opposite to the way the term traditionally has been used?  Have you asked the people using the term socialist this way why they settled on what claims to be the opposite of the usual meaning?\nIf somebody tells you that the definition of a fruit is &#8216;a plant&#8217;, you might want to check why they are not using &#8216;a plant&#8217; to begin with and what the difference is.  If somebody tells you a definition of a fruit which would exclude apples, oranges and strawberries, you might want ask why those are found in your fruit salad.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1705936', 'Paul Brinkley', '2016-04-15T09:46:21+00:00', '1"', '@EMF: Selfless behavior is generally subsumed under rational behavior.

If he won&#8217;t work, and you want to persuade those watching him that working is the best option, you have to punish him, and it has to be a punishment worse than working at the job you want him to do (so, gulag labor or death).

Further, against all odds, communism in East Elbonia actually works: the two countries start with the same GDP per capita, the average (median) citizens of both countries have exactly the same standards of living.  Of course, since it&#8217;s true communist, all East Elbonians have exactly the same standards of living, even (since this is fictional) the heads of the East Elbonian Workers Party.  Meanwhile, West Elbonians have varying standards of living: the rich live in luxury, the poor in relative poverty. \nThe problem is this.  If I&#8217;m an elite East Elbonian, an Olympic athlete, a top scientist, etc., I&#8217;d be much better off if I moved to West Elbonia.  Even a professional, like a doctor or engineer, that&#8217;s part of the upper part of East Elbonian society will be better off crossing the border.  So, instead of giving them the exact same things as everyone else in East Elbonia, I need to either up their standards of living to match their West Elbonian counterparts (which requires lowering someone else&#8217;s) or otherwise prevent them from moving west.\nOn the other hand, if I&#8217;m a drunken lazy West Elbonian who&#8217;s been kicked out of the family for drinking too much instead of working, I can always get a place in East Elbonia.  If I&#8217;m in the East Elbonian government, this is a problem because I now have more people that aren&#8217;t producing as much as they consume (if anything), thus lowering everyone&#8217;s standards of living.  I can rectify this somewhat by forcing these newcomers to work, or I can keep them out at my own expense.  Admittedly, the poorer working class West Elbonians have incentive to move, but this will raise the cost of labor there and, hence their standards of living to the point where it&#8217;s no longer worth it to move east.\nEven given ideal circumstances, this theory states that maintaining a centrally controlled labor market requires preventing the freedom of movement of the people.

One why is the &#8220;why does inflation happen?&#8221;, which is precisely because the Fed prints too much money.  The why you&#8217;re talking about is &#8220;why does the Fed want to inflate the money supply?&#8221;  The answer to that is that the Fed once made a horrible mistake in contracting the money supply, converting a run-of-the-mill recession into The Great Depression, and they committed to never make that error again.  So ever since they have made a different mistake.\nInflation per se doesn&#8217;t help with unemployment, but an abrupt increase in money supply relative to the goods and services in the market can lead to a temporary hiring binge, as people spend the new money and it signals to employers that they can scale up. This is followed by a reduction in spending once that one-time injection passes, at which point employers realize they&#8217;ve geared up for nothing, and trim payrolls accordingly.\nThe fact that inflation allows employers to reduce real wages by a few percent without laying anyone off sounds like a benefit, but the employees aren&#8217;t stupid.  They realize their wages are, in fact, being cut, and some of them will seek, and get, better jobs.  So the good employees have to believe they&#8217;ll get COLAs to make up for the inflation, and the bad employees you&#8217;re better off getting rid of anyway.  Another handy technique is to pay hefty bonuses on top of the base pay.  In down economy, those bonuses shrink (but rarely disappear entirely) and when good times return, the bonuses can go back up.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1707617', 'trying2b-amused', '2016-04-21T01:48:11+00:00', '1"', 'Greg on 2016-04-20 at 11:48:05:\n&gt;what is &#8216;value&#8217;?

If Keynes was right, Marx would also be right &#8211; because what Keynes claims to point out in the mechanism of capitalism is so obviously unjust, that if true, would undermine his whole project of &#8220;trying to save capitalism from itself&#8221;. Because a general demand glut can only happen if all workers get royally, shamelessly shafted. And then there would be a Marxian case for ending capitalism. But  Keynes without Marx is just a bunch of superficial interpretation of empirical data  with no attempt to make a consistent economic-social philosophy like what the eff an economic order is even *for*.\nAnyhow, my point is moderate views are often inconsistent.

I shall do so here.\nThe basic problem here is that EMF still does not address utility in the economic sense, instead treating it as only personal wealth. If productive-X happens to derive personal utility in seeing other people have some of his wealth, then productive-X will gain by exchanging some of his wealth for &#8220;nothing&#8221;. This isn&#8217;t irrational by a free market standard.\nLikewise, if unproductive-X happens to derive personal utility from living within his means, he may wish to decline the exchange with productive-X, because his utility decreases if he accepts the exchange. Again, this is completely rational by a free market standard, because a free market sets no restrictions on an individual&#8217;s use of their property beyond using it to initiate damage to or removal of another&#8217;s. (Case in point: if poor-X preferred not to get rich-X&#8217;s property, and rich-X transferred it anyway, poor-X has a grievance against rich-X, and could even sue rich-X for the cost of taking his property back or having it removed.)\nContrast this with any collectivist system, such as one where rich people R1-R100 can vote on whether some of all their wealth is transferred to poor people P1-P1000. Any of the Rs may derive enough utility from giving away wealth to do it; they will have already done so. Any of them may also derive enough utility from giving away other Rs&#8217; wealth to vote to have it done. In a completely free market, this would not be possible. In this collectivist system, it is not only possible; it is rational, because of the voting rule.\nIf you think of rational behavior as playing by the rules of the system and one&#8217;s knowledge in order to maximize one&#8217;s utility, and irrational behavior as failing to maximize one&#8217;s utility, either by involuntary reflex or due to coercion from something defined as not part of the system, then the free market system permits giving wealth away and forbids forcing others to give theirs away, while any collectivist system, either the one above or any other version, permits both. Neither system encourages irrational behavior, by definition.\nWhat EMF seems to classify as &#8220;irrational&#8221; is any behavior that does not maximize personal wealth. But that&#8217;s only going to happen due to imperfect information, reflex, or a utility function that does not always increase with wealth (e.g. &#8220;selflessness&#8221;), and that happens in any system we&#8217;re talking about. Any non-free market system provides an additional option to maximize personal wealth, namely, by reducing the wealth of other people.\nThis means that any non-free system would not only have to make everyone better off (i.e. maximize their utility) than a free system would; it would have to make them better off by more than the drop in utility they would experience from having some of their wealth taken away.\n'], ['ESR', 'This may be the week the SJWs lost it all', '1707795', 'The Monster', '2016-04-21T17:37:35+00:00', '1"', '&gt; What EMF seems to classify as “irrational” is any behavior that does not maximize personal wealth. But that’s only going to happen due to imperfect information, reflex, or a utility function that does not always increase with wealth &#8230;\nThe key insight is that different people have different utility functions, and no objective standard function exists.  Trade occurs because Alice values the $foo she&#8217;s providing Bob more than the $bar she&#8217;s getting from him in return, and vice versa.  Leftism presumes that all trade is zero-sum because economic value is absolute.  (This is laughable coming from the same people who tell us that moral values are relative, and it&#8217;s wrong for us to judge, say, Muslims committing gang ra&zwj;pe by our Judeo-Christian/Greco-Roman/Anglo-Saxon worldview.)\nCentrally-planned economies are doomed to fail because they don&#8217;t capture the fact that an exchange can leave each party richer (by his own utility function) than before, and by ordering transactions to take place by force (the only way a zero- or even negative-sum transaction can occur) engage in self-fulfilling prophecy:  Once you&#8217;ve decided to have a planned, rather than market economy, you really do have a zero/negative-sum game where everyone has to try to seize control of the planning process so that his tribe can gain at the expense of others.

If the cheap supply of foreign dumped widgets stops, domestic widget production resumes.\nThe edge case(s) where I see a problem come when there&#8217;s an economic cost to changing over to account for dumped resources.  As a purely theoretical example, if a large oil producing state dumps oil on the international market long enough where it drives US oil producers out of business, the US consumers would benefit in the short run from cheap oil, admittedly.  But were the oil producing state to then substantially cut production, it takes a lot of time to bring back that lost domestic oil production, time during which the economy collapses.

Speculators buy oil at the cheap price and store it while the cartel is being nice, if the cartel starts playing around they gets undercut by stored oil. Traders buy oil from countries not embargoed and sell it to the embargoed countries (this happened during the oil embargo). The net effect of the speculators is to raise the price of oil until the probability of cartelism is included in the market price.

While long-term self-interest of the vendors would automatically dictate that, there are plenty of short-termists betting on human stupidity and owned markets can police and regulate that without any sort of a problem.

Our response to 9/11 had a distinct Jacksonian component (we got hurt, make sure the people that did it can&#8217;t do it again) in addition to the internal conflict between the Hamiltonian influences (screw the UN; we need our presence felt in the Middle East) and Wilsonian influences (try to work through the UN, and make sure there&#8217;s no humanitarian crisis).  Having this type of combination is not unusual: World War 2 was run largely on Jacksonian lines (win the war, as hard as possible), but the post war went Wilsonian (build the UN, Marshall plan, etc.), but the Afghanistan/Iraq conflict, instead of being Jacksonian then Hamiltonian or Wilsonian, suffered from trying to be all three at once in conflict while stirring up the Jeffersonians on the left and right in opposition.\nIt might not be obvious to someone that was 5 when 9/11 happened and 12 when Bush left office, but the political situation at the time was not as cut-and-dried as subsequent, often self-serving rationalizations have made it seem.
