Jamie said.\n&#8220;You just got my shoe wet,&#8221; I said.\xa0 I started to point, then winced as skin pulled where the enzymes had eaten away a spot on my arm.\xa0 I held back a cry of pain.\xa0 My arms had taken the brunt of it.\xa0 There wasn&#8217;t a spot on the back of my arms where I could have laid a hand flat without touching something the enzymes had devoured.\xa0 Some of the burns eclipsed my hands in size, and my arms weren&#8217;t large.\xa0 My skin looked like a sock that was as much holes as it was fabric, and the flesh beneath was angry, a scalded red, with blood seeping out from crevices.\nMore burns on a similar scale speckled my neck, one cheek, my side, my legs, and one foot.\xa0 My clothes had absorbed the worst of it, elsewhere, only droplets reaching through.\n&#8220;I saw through the window, but I didn&#8217;t realize how bad it was,&#8221; Jamie said.\xa0 &#8220;I thought you all had everything in hand, but then Sy fell, and I wasn&#8217;t sure if I should go for help-&#8221;\n&#8220;My shoe,&#8221; I commented, managing to point this time around.\xa0 Fixating on one thing made it easier to handle the pain.\xa0 The wounds themselves didn&#8217;t hurt, but the edges burned like fire.\n&#8220;Sy didn&#8217;t fall.\xa0 He took a fall.\xa0 Wording,&#8221; Gordon said.\nJamie&#8217;s expression switched from confusion to an accusing glance.\xa0 Thinking that Gordon might be wrong didn&#8217;t even cross his mind.\n&#8220;Why?&#8221; Jamie asked.\xa0 &#8220;You got yourself badly hurt, you twit.&#8221;\n&#8220;Did I?&#8221; I tried to exaggerate the surprise in my voice, and all the pain-relief chemicals that my body was dosing me with made me sound even more exaggerated, my voice almost breaking.\xa0 I added some sarcasm for good measure, &#8220;Oh.\xa0 I hadn&#8217;t noticed.\xa0 Thank you.&#8221;\nLillian spoke up, &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing too dangerous.\xa0 I don&#8217;t like some of these spots on your side, but I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re going to die from it.\xa0 Not soon.&#8221;\n&#8220;Not soon.\xa0 That&#8217;s the best we can hope for,&#8221; I said.\nJamie looked closer at one of the wounds.\xa0 With Gordon still supporting me and both Jamie and Lillian fussing, there were a few more accidental touches of the burns.\xa0 One of the touches didn&#8217;t actually hurt so much, but I played it up, flinching and letting a gasp out, if only to get them to stop.\n&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him distract you,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;He&#8217;s trying to dodge the &#8216;why&#8217; question.&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to hurry this along,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Priorities.\xa0 Can I get medical attention?\xa0 Pretty please?&#8221;\n&#8220;Still dodging the question,&#8221; Gordon observed.\n&#8220;Let&#8217;s go,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Wait.\xa0 Jamie needs to pick up my shoe, which is getting soaked through, then we can go.\xa0 Maybe since Jamie won&#8217;t stop touching me to make sure I&#8217;m okay, Jamie and Lillian can make sure I walk okay?&#8221;\nGordon looked me over, suspicious.\xa0 &#8220;You&#8217;ll tell us on the way, then?&#8221;\n&#8220;Assuming there&#8217;s something to tell,&#8221; I said.\xa0 I felt the burning at my wrist get worse, and my little noise of pain wasn&#8217;t intentional.\xa0 I reached for my wrist, and Lillian slapped my hand away like I was a kid going for the cookie jar.\xa0 For her benefit, I said, &#8220;Hurts.&#8221;\n&#8220;Good,&#8221; she said, sounding like a cross between the bossy older sister and a schoolteacher.\xa0 &#8220;Maybe you won&#8217;t do that again.&#8221;\nShe wiped at my arm, clearing away blood where it had welled out from the center of the burn.\xa0 Where the blood had run through the edges of the scar, the trickle had left a faint pink line.\xa0 Spreading the enzyme around.\n&#8220;Sy,&#8221; Gordon said.\n&#8220;Gordon,&#8221; I cut him off.\nThere was a pause.\xa0 I hesitated to call it tension.\xa0 He wanted me to come to my senses, I wanted to wait long enough for his concern for my well being to override his curiosity, which was bound to happen sooner or later.\xa0 Tension implied something being stretched to a limit, but we were both being patient.\nI felt the burning sensation at my side getting worse.\xa0 From a six to a seven on the scale, and I was the one who caved, in the end.\n&#8220;I promise I&#8217;ll tell you after,&#8221; I said.\nHe seemed to consider, rolling his head to one side, then the other.\n&#8220;Fine.\xa0 Jamie, take over?&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;Seems to want you for some reason.&#8221;\n&#8220;Jamie is shorter, I don&#8217;t have to stand on my tip toes while he&#8217;s holding me up,&#8221; I explained.\nGordon transferred his hold on me to Jamie, who had to transfer his hold on his book to the other arm.\n&#8220;And he&#8217;s nicer,&#8221; I added.\xa0 Jamie rolled his eyes.\n&#8220;Did you lock the windows?&#8221; Gordon asked, ignoring me.\xa0 The question was aimed at Helen, who had emerged from the door behind us.\nI turned my head to see Helen&#8217;s nod.\xa0 She and Gordon worked to slide the door closed.\xa0 The movement of the wheel through the rut spat water at our legs.\n&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope it stays put,&#8221; Gordon said.\n&#8220;I thought we decided that it wouldn&#8217;t go anywhere after eating,&#8221; Lillian said.\xa0 &#8220;Carnivore eating habits.\xa0 Hunt or scavenge, eat, rest, rouse, repeat.&#8221;\n&#8220;It was hungry enough to eat two meals.\xa0 Probably going through a final growth spurt,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Let&#8217;s not rule anything out.&#8221;\n&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Lillian said, right beside me, and I was genuinely surprised at the note of anxiety in her voice, how it had cut the word short.\xa0 &#8220;We can leave now.&#8221;\nVery nearly but not a question.\xa0 A plea?\nI suspected it was fear, but that suspicion sat askew in my head.\xa0 Lillian had experience with that stuff.\xa0 She&#8217;d had hands on experience with creatures and experiments at the Academy.\xa0 More restrained than that one had been, but the idea of the unrestrained experiment wasn&#8217;t enough to justify the thought.\xa0 It was probably well fed enough that it would ignore any meal that didn&#8217;t walk right into its open mouth.\nOr lay there struggling as the snake charmer had.\nThere we are,\xa0I thought.\xa0 The snake charmer.\xa0 I could remember Lillian shielding her eyes.\xa0 The anxiety had more to do with the reminder of the man and the way he&#8217;d left this world.\xa0 If he had left it.\xa0 There was a chance he was still in there, alive and slowly dissolving.\nGordon had collected the bundle of shoes but hadn&#8217;t handed them out.\xa0 Which was fine.\xa0 My feet were muddy, and I had a burn on the top of my foot that would have made wearing the shoes hard.\xa0 The burn announced its presence every time I stepped in a puddle.\nIt wasn&#8217;t a particularly short walk back, and I was content to keep my mouth shut.\xa0 If I started talking, I might have started grunting or making noises in response to the pain.\xa0 If I started whimpering, then Gordon might have started reminding me that I&#8217;d done this to myself.\nInstead, I focused on the future.\xa0 The snake charmer had been handled.\xa0 Were questions possible?\xa0 What about my injuries?\n&#8220;We&#8217;re close to King,&#8221; Jamie said, interrupting my thoughts.\xa0 I realized Helen and Gordon were talking, with Gordon doing the lion&#8217;s share.\xa0 I&#8217;d tuned it out.\n&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I noted.\n&#8220;Busy street means head down,&#8221; Jamie said, very patient.\xa0 He tugged on the front of my hood, so it could shroud my face in shadow.\xa0 &#8220;Hood down.\xa0 We don&#8217;t want your face to scare the locals any more than usual.&#8221;\nI couldn&#8217;t help but smile wide at that.\nThe main street was framed on both sides by taller buildings, a great many of them being apartments.\xa0 People sat on steps beneath the overhang of their porches, smoking, and the occasional light glowed from within rooms above.\nThe plant growth that supported the structures reached overhead to meet and mesh.\xa0 An arch, to introduce us to the main street proper.\xa0 King Street.\xa0 It was a thick crowd, even in the late afternoon, the sun setting.\xa0 Men and women in raincoats, with umbrellas, walking on either side of the road.\nLillian and Jamie stopped supporting me quite so much.\xa0 I started to teeter over a bit, and Jamie caught me at roughly the same point I stuck a leg out to catch my balance myself.\xa0 I hadn&#8217;t realized how heavily I&#8217;d been leaning on the others, or how dizzy I felt.\nHorses pulling coaches outnumbered cars at a nine to one ratio.\xa0 Of those horses drawing coaches, only one in five were truly alive.\xa0 The remainder were stitched, their hides patchwork, seams joined by thick black thread or by metal staples with burns where they touched flesh.\xa0 Were I able to see beneath the heavy raincoats, I would have seen the thick metal bolts that had been screwed into points down their spines.\nLive horses were an affectation, really.\xa0 There was a convenience to them, as they didn&#8217;t suffer from the water in this city where it always rained, they could be taken out hunting, and they had personalities.\xa0 A horse could be a member of one&#8217;s family.\xa0 There was a lot to like.\nBut the stitched horses, voltaic horses if you asked someone who knew what they were talking about, they were cheap, they didn&#8217;t get tired, and rather than food, they could be kept going by connecting wires to the bolts on their backs and waiting.\xa0 When a stitched horse had done its work for the day, it could be placed in what amounted to a long closet.\nThere were no rules for the road, but everyone found their way.\xa0 Most people here knew most others.\xa0 A lack of courtesy today could be paid by a lack of cooperation from others tomorrow.\xa0 That wasn&#8217;t to say there weren&#8217;t idiots or disagreeable types who others paid no mind to, but it largely worked.\nLike the branches and plant growth, it amounted to a planned chaos.\xa0 The exact shape and character of branches couldn&#8217;t be decided in advance, but the key elements were given attention, the problematic ones pruned.\xa0 The squat apartment buildings didn&#8217;t have room for even stitched horses, which meant every essential service had been put within walking distance.\xa0 Pubs, grocers, tailors, barbers and the like.\nI raised my eyes.\xa0 Looking down the length of King, I could see it rise at a gradual incline, until it touched the perimeter of the Academy itself.\xa0 Radham Academy, to be specific.\xa0 All things flowed from it, all things flowed to it.\xa0 I imagined the same went for any Academy.\xa0 Stick one somewhere, and people would collect to it like flies to a carcass.\xa0 The advances and work that went hand in hand with an Academy would bleed out in a very similar way.\xa0 First to the city as a whole, then to surrounding regions.\nJamie grabbed the tip of my hood and tugged down, forcing me to look at the ground in front of me.\xa0 I&#8217;d been showing too much of my face.\nWe moved as a huddle, and with our heads down and hoods up, we weren&#8217;t much different from half of the streets&#8217; occupants.\xa0 My burns didn&#8217;t earn me a second glance, because I scarcely warranted a first one.\xa0 I suspected that Gordon had chosen where he stood with the idea of shielding me from others&#8217; sight, for added assurance.\nI liked the thought.\xa0 It made me wonder if any other people in the crowd were in similar straits.\nAhead of us, a large shape loomed.\xa0 It looked like the offspring of a deer or rabbit might, if their offspring was squeezed out too early.\xa0 No larger than one of the cars on the street, it was pink, with stretched skin, the translucent eyelids appearing bruised with how they let some of the darkness of the black eyeballs beneath leak through.\xa0 Its head sat crooked, forcing it to see the way forward with only one of its two wide set eyes.\xa0 Its mouth hung open.\nMost prominent, however, were the legs.\xa0 Not much thicker around than my leg, half again as long as the tallest man on the sidewalk was tall, the four legs ended in points, a single claw to each leg.\xa0 Saddlebags were strapped to saddlebags to form chains that draped the thing like a peculiar sort of jewelry.\nAs the coaches and cars on the road made way and cooperated, so did the people on the sidewalk.\xa0 This however, was motivated by discomfort and fear.\xa0 Men and women gave the thing almost the entire sidewalk to itself.\nA woman led it on a fine chain, holding an umbrella overhead, though the creature&#8217;s mass already helped shelter her from the rain.\xa0 She was barely entering into her twilight years, but only the pale color of her once-blonde hair suggested as much.\xa0 Her face and body were young, and her clothes looked expensive, though they tended toward the simple.\nI very nearly tipped over again, as Jamie let go of me and stepped forward to obscure the woman&#8217;s view of me.\nFeeling as wobbly as I did was more than a little concerning, and a delay was the last thing I wanted.\n&#8220;Hello Mrs. Thetford,&#8221; Helen greeted the woman, smiling.\n&#8220;Helen,&#8221; Mrs. Thetford said, tugging on the chain to make her packbeast stop in its tracks.\xa0 Her expression changed from an easy smile to shock.\xa0 &#8220;Look at you!\xa0 You look like something the cat dragged in!&#8221;\nHow apt, I thought.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s Sylvester&#8217;s fault,&#8221; Helen said.\xa0 &#8220;He pushed me and I got wet.&#8221;\nOf course she invents a lie that makes me look bad.\xa0 I made a point of hanging my head, to better conceal my injuries.\xa0 I could see the crowd passing around and to either side of us.\n&#8220;Sylvester, for shame,&#8221; Mrs. Thetford said, and she used my name as a rebuke, and the way she said &#8216;shame&#8217; even made me feel a bit abashed over the deed I hadn&#8217;t committed.\xa0 &#8220;You really should be nicer to girls.&#8221;\n&#8220;He really should,&#8221; Helen said, and her tone was perfect.\xa0 Just a little bit smug, chiding, but not so much of either that Mrs. Thetford would think less of her.\n&#8220;And you,&#8221; Mrs. Thetford said, reaching under Helen&#8217;s hood to comb Helen&#8217;s hair back with long fingernails.\xa0 &#8220;You should give some thought to keeping better company.\xa0 I know you&#8217;re loyal to your so-called brothers and sisters, but you could do so well if you devoted some time to others.\xa0 Your caregivers have very nearly polished you into a diamond, and it would warm my heart to see you finish the transformation.&#8221;\n&#8220;Thank you, Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; Helen said, smiling, pretending to be a little shy.\xa0 Not a lot, but enough to be humble.\xa0 &#8220;It means a lot that you think so well of me.&#8221;\n&#8220;If you decide that you would like to become more of a lady, I would be more than happy to introduce you to some people who could teach you the finer points.\xa0 Music, dancing, etiquette.\xa0 The same goes for you, Gordon.\xa0 You&#8217;re evidence that Helen here isn&#8217;t a simple fluke.\xa0 It would take more doing, but I think we could turn you into a proper gentleman with some tutoring.&#8221;\n&#8220;I might take you up on that offer, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; Gordon said.\n&#8220;Do!\xa0 You should,&#8221; the older woman said.\xa0 She brushed Helen&#8217;s cheek with her fingers.\xa0 &#8220;You&#8217;re a dear.\xa0 I would have you for myself, if I hadn&#8217;t already had my fill of raising children.&#8221;\n&#8220;For now, if it&#8217;s alright, I&#8217;ll have to content myself with getting home before it&#8217;s dark.\xa0 I&#8217;m looking forward to getting dry again,&#8221; Helen said, sticking me with a look.\n&#8220;Of course!\xa0 Now I feel bad for keeping you.\xa0 You know where to find me if you would like those lessons.&#8221;\nWe hurried on.\xa0 Rather than take the long route around to the sides, we passed under and between the legs of the packbeast that was carrying Mrs. Thetford&#8217;s shopping.\nBy the time we&#8217;d flowed back into the crowd, almost invisible, Helen&#8217;s expression had gone flat again, her eyes cold.\xa0 The smile was gone.\nShe saw me looking.\n&#8220;Are you upset?&#8221; she asked.\n&#8220;Why would I be upset?&#8221;\n&#8220;I blamed you.&#8221;\n&#8220;I always get blamed.\xa0 I&#8217;m used to it.&#8221;\nShe seemed to take that at face value.\nI might have pursued conversation, but it would have been purely for self gratification, and I was feeling less and less like talking.\xa0 My brain had apparently decided that the easiest way to handle what I was feeling was to declare that all of me hurt, and certain parts of me hurt enough that I was reconsidering my &#8216;one to ten&#8217; scale of pain.\xa0 If I focused on any one part of me too much, it quickened.\nAll of that in mind, I was very glad to see the orphanage.\nThe building was perched in an odd spot, beside a creek and a stone bridge that was thick with grown-in vegetation. The land by the riverbed was stony, uneven, and threatened to be damp, discouraging building efforts, but the building itself had been here long before the Academy, serving as a home for shepherds when Radham had only been a few buildings set around a crossroads.\nThat it had withstood the test of time was either pure luck, or the person who had mortared the stones together had known what they were doing.\nOne floor tall, with a stone exterior, it lacked the reinforcing growths that marked so many nearby structures.\xa0 The only wood came from a tree in the backyard.\xa0 A short stone wall encircled the property, only three feet tall, and the height both served as a way of keeping the smallest children on the property and was paradoxically welcoming.\xa0 I couldn&#8217;t approach it without wanting to hop up onto it.\nToward the back of the property, I could see that Ralph Stein was in the process of walking the top of the wall.\xa0 The route went from the right side of the gate, over to the right of the house, alongside the riverbank, around the back of the house, under the tricky bit where the tree&#8217;s branches hung over, up the left side of the house, and then over to the left side of the gate.\xa0 All on the weather-rounded, uneven stones that made up the wall&#8217;s top, virtually always in the rain.\nMy focus wasn&#8217;t on that.\nMy focus was on the black coach parked to the left of the house, beneath the overhang in the roof.\xa0 The horses were wearing black raincoats, utterly still.\xa0 Their driver stood beside them, smoking.\nMy eye didn&#8217;t leave them as we made our way down the steps that had been set into the slope.\xa0 Each one of the stone stairs had seen enough traffic and years that they&#8217;d been reshaped, as if buckling faintly under thousands of footfalls.\nGordon pushed open the door.\xa0 Lillian and Jamie helped me through.\nWe stopped in our tracks at the sight of a man in the front hallway.\nIf it had a brain and a nervous system, the parts could be used for making a stitch, or voltaic creature.\xa0 The quality of that stitched was indicated by the placement of the stitches that gave them their name.\xa0 Poorer work or a stitched that had been &#8216;repaired&#8217; often involved joins in visible or inconvenient places.\xa0 Across the face, or across the joints, where they interfered with function.\xa0 A good stitch had the joins and scars kept just out of sight, under the chin, or in places where clothes could cover the work.\nThe figure that stood guard by the door was the most human-like stitched I&#8217;d ever seen.\xa0 Tall, broad-shouldered, the parts had been selected for size and raw power.\xa0 But for stitches visible just past the cuffs of his jacket, I might not have known.\xa0 He wore a suit under a hooded raincoat and carried a pistol at his hip.\nHe was, in two short words, a problem.\nI smelled tea, and I heard very little commotion.\xa0 If I hadn&#8217;t seen the coach outside, I could have put two and two together to figure out that we had a guest.\n&#8220;That would be the children,&#8221; Mrs. Earles said.\nThe others properly put away hoods, cloaks, shoes and boots before toweling their feet to a reasonable state of clean and dry.\xa0 Lillian bent down and had me lift up my feet one by one to dry them.\n&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; I murmured.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here for,&#8221; she murmured back.\nOne by one, we headed around the corner from the front hall, into the sitting room.\xa0 The room itself had homey touches, and was very much Mrs. Earles.\xa0 It was her perch in the evenings, the part she made her home.\xa0 The knick-knacks and decorative carvings, still, were placed well out of reach of errant hands, on the mantlepiece above the blazing fireplace and on various shelves and bookshelves.\nMy eyes scanned the shelves and bookshelves.\xa0 Searching.\nMrs. Earles didn&#8217;t give off the image of someone who ran an orphanage.\xa0 She&#8217;d struck me more as the assistant to that sort of someone.\xa0 Managing one child had a way of turning women into mothers, wearing away at certain things while exaggerating others.\xa0 Even with help, managing sixteen should have pushed her to an extreme in some respect.\xa0 Something in the vein of a tyrant or a defeated woman, a woman who turned to vice to escape stresses, or a saint.\xa0 But she wasn&#8217;t any of those things.\nA part of me wanted to think of her as a mother, but she wasn&#8217;t.\xa0 She didn&#8217;t pretend to be.\xa0 She ran Lambsbridge, she kept us fed and sheltered, and she was quick to use the threat of a smack to keep us in line.\xa0 Even though I&#8217;d been a recipient more than once, I could appreciate that she didn&#8217;t hesitate in that respect.\xa0 I had to live with fifteen others, and if they were allowed to run rampant, I faced more grief than I did dealing with the occasional rap to the knuckles.\nMr. Hayle, by that same token, was almost but not quite my father.\nHe frowned as he saw me, immediately taking in details that more than a hundred people in the busier part of the city had failed to spot.\n&#8220;I&#8217;ll make sure you don&#8217;t have eavesdroppers,&#8221; Mrs. Earles said, disappearing.\n&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Mr. Hayle said, without turning to look at her.\nWe stood in the entry to the sitting room, while he examined each of us, silent.\nHe was an older man.\xa0 Sixty or so, as far as anyone&#8217;s age could be pinned down with certainty.\xa0 He hadn&#8217;t prettied himself up or taken advantage of Radham Academy&#8217;s resources to remove wrinkles or revitalize his hair.\xa0 His hair was grey and waxed back away from his face, and his wrinkles cut so deep into his face that I could have imagined them as cross-hatching done with a scalpel.\xa0 He wore a doctor&#8217;s coat indoors, the fabric thick, dyed black so that it wouldn&#8217;t show any blood stains.\xa0 His gloves had been pulled off, and the ends were sticking out of one pocket.\xa0 A collection of files were already tucked under one arm.\n&#8220;The other children are accounted for.\xa0 I&#8217;ll be in the kitchen, where I can intercept anyone coming your way,&#8221; Mrs. Earles said.\n&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said.\nShe retreated, leaving us alone.\n&#8220;I was planning on a longer meeting,&#8221; Mr. Hayle said.\xa0 &#8220;To look at Sylvester, he might not be able to stand for the duration.\xa0 Is he stable?&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;m stable,&#8221; I said, at the same time Lillian said, &#8220;He is.&#8221;\nMr. Hayle frowned.\xa0 &#8220;What happened to you?\xa0 No.\xa0 Hold off on that.\xa0 If you&#8217;re stable, let&#8217;s cover the essentials.\xa0 Tell me, how was it?&#8221;\nGordon answered.\xa0 &#8220;Our target&#8217;s second experiment is in one of the warehouses, off to the southeast of King.\xa0 Sleeping off a meal, we&#8217;re hoping.\xa0 It&#8217;s there, with all of the notes.\xa0 As for the target, he&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;\n&#8220;In his experiment,&#8221; I said, managing a smile.\nMr. Hayle didn&#8217;t smile back.\xa0 &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.\xa0 Clarify?&#8221;\n&#8220;Dead,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;Swallowed.&#8221;\n&#8220;Complications?&#8221;\nWe collectively uttered a chorus of &#8216;nos&#8217; and shook our heads.\xa0 I glanced at the back of Jamie&#8217;s head, saw the faintest hesitation before he joined us in shaking his head.\n&#8220;What happened to Sylvester?&#8221;\n&#8220;The snake charm- ah, our target, he arrived, forcing us to hide.\xa0 He found me in my hiding spot, purely by chance, and took me hostage.\xa0 Sylvester distracted him, and was splashed with-&#8221;\n&#8220;Enzymes,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;Splashed with enzymes, during the altercation that followed.&#8221;\n&#8220;I did what I could,&#8221; Lillian said, &#8220;Neutralized the spread with counteragents our target had on hand.&#8221;\nMr. Hayle nodded.\xa0 &#8220;Good.\xa0 Lillian, I believe this marks your third assignment with the group?&#8221;\n&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;\n&#8220;Would you do another?&#8221;\nI didn&#8217;t miss the hesitation on Lillian&#8217;s part.\nI tried to view things through her eyes.\xa0 Seeing the man get swallowed.\xa0 The horror.\n&#8220;I would, sir,&#8221; she decided.\n&#8220;Good.\xa0 You&#8217;ll continue to have my support at the Academy, then.\xa0 If you don&#8217;t find all doors are open and all resources available to you, let me know.\xa0 Your tuition will continue to be waived.&#8221;\n&#8220;Thank you sir.&#8221;\n&#8220;That takes care of the, ah, what did you call him?\xa0 The snake charmer?\xa0 Now, unless there&#8217;s anything else, I should look after Sylvester there.&#8221;\nThere was a jumble of &#8216;no sir&#8217;s from the others.\nHe crossed the room, and the others were quick to get out of his way.\xa0 I used the opportunity to move to one side, further into the sitting room, and scanned the shelves.\nThere.\nMrs. Earles didn&#8217;t keep matches close to the fireplace, and she didn&#8217;t keep them where the smaller children could get them.\nEven for me, it would require that I stand on my toes and reach high overhead.\nThe problems that came with being small.\nMr. Hayle was talking while he found and put on his boots.\xa0 &#8220;I do want to have a longer discussion.\xa0 I&#8217;ll need to rearrange my evening, which will take me at least an hour.\xa0 Add the time it takes to deliver Sylvester&#8230; hm, it would be late.\xa0 Too late?&#8221;\n&#8220;The younger children will be in bed.\xa0 I could ask Mrs. Earles,&#8221; Gordon said.\n&#8220;No.\xa0 I&#8217;ll be by in the morning.\xa0 I only considered tonight because I thought you&#8217;d want to know how Sylvester was.\xa0 I can send someone your way, if you&#8217;re willing to keep an eye out the window for them.\xa0 A quiet, short visit to pass on word.&#8221;\n&#8220;Please, sir,&#8221; Gordon said, sounding far more solemn than I&#8217;d have expected.\n&#8220;I&#8217;ll see to it.\xa0 Thank you for another job well done.\xa0 Sylvester?&#8221;\nI was out of time.\nWith a wall between myself and Mr. Hayle, each of the others positioned to see, I reached up to the shelf, and felt my burns stretch, eliciting a tearing sensation, and a fresh renewal of pain.\nI closed my fingers around the matchbook, then collapsed against the wall, panting.\n&#8220;Problem?&#8221;\n&#8220;Moved too fast,&#8221; I said.\nMr. Hayle gave me a sincere look of concern as he did up the buttons of his coat and took his umbrella from his stitched bodyguard.\n&#8220;Let&#8217;s get you looked after,&#8221; he said.\xa0 He paused.\xa0 &#8220;No shoes?&#8221;\n&#8220;Burn on my foot,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;Carry on, then.&#8221;\nI discovered that stopping and then moving again was quite possibly the worst thing I could have done.\xa0 Every burn felt fresh.\xa0 The movement of my arm was the worst of it.\xa0 The stitched bodyguard helped me, even going so far as to lift me bodily to my seat.\xa0 All the same, by the time we reached the coach, I was sweating bullets from pain alone.\nThe coach&#8217;s interior was red, the windows stained to reduce the light that came in, and something that looked like a glowing orange minnow swam in a bowl overhead, casting light on the interior.\nThe driver steered the stitched horses around.\xa0 Before long, we were on King Street, heading for the Academy.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s rare that I have a chance to talk with one of you,&#8221; Mr. Hayle said.\xa0 &#8220;Can I see your arm?&#8221;\nI offered it.\xa0 He probed the edges of the injury.\n&#8220;I suspect you&#8217;ll resist, out of loyalty to your&#8230; brothers and sisters?\xa0 Is that how you think of them?&#8221;\n&#8220;Friends.\xa0 Gang,&#8221; I said.\xa0 I swallowed hard.\xa0 &#8220;Sometimes I think of them as siblings.\xa0 What am I resisting?&#8221;\n&#8220;Giving me information.\xa0 Can you tell me if they&#8217;re doing alright?&#8221;\n&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;They&#8217;re doing everything they&#8217;re supposed to do.&#8221;\n&#8220;Is that so?\xa0 Something tells me you wouldn&#8217;t tell me if they weren&#8217;t.&#8221;\nI smiled a little.\xa0 &#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;ve watched you grow up these past few years.\xa0 I&#8217;d like to think I know you.&#8221;\nI nodded.\xa0 I forbade myself from looking outside the window.\n&#8220;Not up to talking?&#8221;\n&#8220;Not sure what to say, sir.&#8221;\n&#8220;Tell me about the snake charmer.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yes sir.\xa0 Um-&#8221;\nA crash shook the coach.\nI could hear shouts.\xa0 Mr. Hayle&#8217;s coach came to an awkward stop, lurching, then jerking to the left before finally going still.\nHe twisted in his seat, and slid a panel to one side.\xa0 &#8220;John?&#8221;\nThere was a pause.\xa0 The driver replied, &#8220;Water.\xa0 Knocked me off my seat.\xa0 One of the voltaic horses got drenched.\xa0 It&#8217;s gone quiet.&#8221;\n&#8220;Water?&#8221;\xa0 Mr. Hayle asked.\xa0 He frowned.\xa0 &#8220;I&#8217;ll be right out.&#8221;\nI remained where I was, very much in pain after the sudden movements.\n&#8220;Douglas,&#8221; Mr. Hayle said.\xa0 &#8220;Look after Sylvester.\xa0 Be ready to come outside at a moment&#8217;s notice.&#8221;\n&#8220;I understand,&#8221; Douglas said, the words clumsy in a way that was hard to define.\xa0 Too precise, the local accent rounded off at the edges.\xa0 I suspected it would be worse if it was a more unfamiliar phrase.\nThe door of the coach closed.\nOne, two, three.\nI forced myself to sit up.\nI opened my eyes.\nNaturally, going outside, Mr. Hayle hadn&#8217;t taken his paperwork.\nWhen problem solving, the simplest answer shouldn&#8217;t be discounted.\nI reached for the files.\nThe bodyguard reached out, blocking my hand with his.\n&#8220;That is not yours,&#8221; he said.\xa0 The words were clumsier than his &#8216;I understand.&#8217;\nIf it was a human bodyguard, and not one that had died and been reanimated, rendered very simple and loyal in operation, I suspected I could have manipulated him or sent him out of the coach.\nStitched were easier in some ways, harder in others.\nI pulled the matches out of my pocket.\nI struck it.\nHe didn&#8217;t flinch.\nI blinked.\nReduced to very primal, simple function, they were supposed to have reactions to fire.\xa0 Nine times out of ten, it was fear.\xa0 One time out of ten, it was violent and destructive rage.\nThe quality of this stitched was top notch.\xa0 Had Mr. Hayle or the person he bought the stitched from somehow solved the problem?\n&#8220;Put that out,&#8221; the stitched told me.\nI reached out, bringing the match closer to him.\nHe didn&#8217;t move.\n&#8220;Put that out,&#8221; he said, more firmly.\nI moved my hand, and he remained where he was.\nNo, the problem hadn&#8217;t been fixed.\xa0 But they&#8217;d found a step forward.\nHe was frozen.\nI&#8217;d hoped to distract and disturb him enough that he&#8217;d forget his instructions and let me snatch up the files.\xa0 This, however, worked.\xa0 Still holding the match up, the whole of his attention focused on it, I grabbed the stack of folders.\nI returned to my seat.\nBefore I could open the folders, the door opened.\nMr. Hayle studied me, his expression blank.\nI froze, caught red handed.\xa0 Well, the red hand was the burn, but-\n&#8220;And it all makes sense,&#8221; he said.\n&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;Sylvester,&#8221; he said, climbing up into the coach and taking his seat, &#8220;You know why I made you.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yes sir.&#8221;\n&#8220;Each of you.\xa0 My colleagues in other departments have made weapons, monsters, they&#8217;ve made viruses and more, with the understanding that there may very well be a need for these weapons.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;My focus, as you very well know, is on,&#8221; he reached over, and he tapped me on the forehead.\xa0 &#8220;The brain.&#8221;\n&#8220;And I was dumb just now,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Failed project?&#8221;\n&#8220;No,&#8221; he said.\xa0 &#8220;No.\xa0 I made you.\xa0 Like I said, I know you.&#8221;\n&#8220;If it helps, I&#8217;m starting to believe you, sir.&#8221;\n&#8220;It would be stupid of me to make you for a purpose and not expect you to fulfill that purpose.\xa0 Mistakes here and there are to be expected, and your mistake here was expecting me to be dumb.\xa0 You&#8217;re still developing, and each of you are still being refined in your own ways.&#8221;\nI nodded.\n&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you ask for the files?&#8221; he asked me.\n&#8220;Because you might have said no, and you would have known I wanted them,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;And because I think people are more genuine when you catch them off balance.&#8221;\nHe nodded.\n&#8220;Something to keep in mind,&#8221; he said.\xa0 &#8220;And I suppose I&#8217;m getting too predictable, if you were able to arrange this.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;Take a look,&#8221; he said.\nFor a telling second, I thought the files would be empty, that he might have checkmated me.\nBut I paged through them, and I found them filled with pages of data, notes, design, and more.\nHelen, project Galatea.\nJamie, project Caterpillar.\nGordon, project Griffon.\nSylvester, project Wyvern\nI found the fourth file.\xa0 The one I&#8217;d wanted.\nI glanced over the first page, then closed it, nodding.\n&#8220;Why?&#8221; Mr. Hayle asked.\xa0 &#8220;All that for a glance?&#8221;\n&#8220;Yes sir.&#8221;\n&#8220;What, specifically?&#8221;\n&#8220;Expiration dates,

Next\nThe syringe was fancy, glass with silver leaf at the ends and at the plunger.\xa0 The glass had turned smoky where it had once been clear, and only the faintest trace of the original contents were still inside.\xa0 Thicker around than any three of my fingers put together.\xa0 It probably cost twenty dollars, if not more.\xa0 A good week&#8217;s wages.\nSomewhat vindictively, I pulled out the plunger until I had the weight balanced, put my fingers on it, and sent it spinning wildly on the desk, periodically rustling scattered papers or sending them floating over the desk&#8217;s surface, riding a thin layer of air.\xa0 Traveling across the desk, it struck an identical syringe, eliciting a pair of high, sweet songs from the ringing glass.\nIt didn&#8217;t break.\xa0 Shame.\nI stepped over to the window, my feet kicking up more papers as they might stir leaves in the fall.\xa0 I was at &#8216;the Hedge&#8217;, the colloquial term for the wall that encircled the Academy.\xa0 A great deal of the wall wasn&#8217;t large or tall at all, but it rose in places, and the corner of the Academy closest to Radham had a hospital built into it.\xa0 Through the hospital, students bought their turns at getting training and locals bought care.\xa0 The view was of the wall itself, the Academy on one side, Radham on the other.\nAbout the only thing that was the same about the two places was that it was raining.\xa0 A light rain, but enough that just about everyone had their hoods up.\xa0 The boys and girls on the Academy side moved as though they were all in a hurry.\xa0 They were all tidy, hair well looked after, white uniforms clean.\xa0 Their bookbags had flaps over the top to keep the rain out, and the buckles that kept the flaps in place each had the university&#8217;s symbol on it, a full-face helmet in profile framed by red leaves and ribbons.\nAlmost but not quite a badge of office.\nOutside, watched from a distance, people moved as though they were mired in tar.\xa0 They found their way eventually, but there was no clear direction, even in a city that had been built with a plan in mind.\nI didn&#8217;t enjoy looking, but there wasn&#8217;t much else to be done.\xa0 I&#8217;d read the books, I&#8217;d read the various papers, and I&#8217;d slept.\xa0 Seven days I&#8217;d been cooped up here.\nI felt a chill, and rubbed my hands over my bare arms.\xa0 My skin had been replaced where the enzyme solution had devoured it, and while the pigmentation was very slightly different if I looked for it, it remained sensitive, not yet used to heat and cold, to the rubbing where seams of clothing touched it, or to idle scratches.\xa0 I kept my shirt off, but that meant being colder, and though it was dawn and spring had sprung, it was gloomy outside.\nI held the back of my hand up to the edges of the window, letting the sensitive skin feel the movements of the air.\xa0 Slowly, so as not to disturb the air with my own movements, I moved my hand along the point where the window glass met the frame.\nI felt the point where the breeze came through as though ice had touched the new skin.\xa0 Pulling my hand away, I tore the end off one page of paper and popped the paper into my mouth before setting the syringe to spinning at full speed once again.\nThe syringe rattled as I got the motion wrong, and the rattle prompted the papers under the cot to rustle.\xa0 Not because I&#8217;d moved or because I was going anywhere.\nPeriodically, someone came to talk to me.\xa0 I was already figuring out their schedules.\xa0 Going by the time of day and the schedules I&#8217;d observed over the past week, they were past due to arrive.\nBeing past due meant they were up to something.\xa0 I was tense, chewing on the little bit of paper, listening past the patter of the rain on the window and the sound of the syringe spinning on the desktop.\nI could hear the murmur of speech, too far away and muted to make out.\nI recognized Mr. Hayle&#8217;s voice.\n&#8220;-Or worse than before?&#8221; I could make out the tail end of the sentence.\n&#8220;More or less the same, professor.\xa0 But as intractable as he gets, his behavior differs from month to month.\xa0 This time, he wanted to be alone.\xa0 Very much so.&#8221;\n&#8220;I wonder if it has something to do with the fact that it followed so quickly off the back of another incident, or the pain he was experiencing.\xa0 Make a note.\xa0 If we&#8217;re bringing another student on board to oversee the Wyvern file, that would be a good way to bring them up to speed while doing something constructive.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yes, professor.&#8221;\nThere was a pause, pronounced, then a knock on the door.\n&#8220;Sylvester?&#8221;\nI didn&#8217;t respond right away.\xa0 Reaching up to my mouth, I pulled the wad of paper out, then jammed it up against the gap in the window where it was leaking cold air.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m here,&#8221; I said.\nThe door opened.\xa0 It only opened a few inches before it hit the toppled bookcase that barred the way.\xa0 The rest of the floor was carpeted in scattered papers, fallen books, and various folders.\nI angled my head to one side, and saw Mr. Hayle do the same, peering through the gap.\xa0 He looked at me first, then the bookcase.\n&#8220;How are you?&#8221; he asked.\n&#8220;My head hurts,&#8221; I said.\xa0 It did.\xa0 It hurt in a very different way than my body had.\xa0 My body had been effectively burned by the enzymes, and burns hurt more than just about anything.\xa0 My brain, however, it felt like it had been poked, prodded, beaten and kicked into the dirt, then made to do a marathon after the fact.\xa0 The burn only hurt the parts that were burned.\xa0 This was the sort of pain that made everything hurt, and promised more pain every step of the way for the rest of the journey.\nA hollow, empty, tired hurt.\n&#8220;I can well imagine.\xa0 How in the world did you pull over the shelf?&#8221;\nWhat he was asking was how a boy who weighed four point seven stone could pull over a floor-to-ceiling solid wood bookcase with half the books still on it.\xa0 Mr. Hayle might not have been able to knock it down in the prime of his youth.\n&#8220;I pushed the upper corner,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Then I dropped a book into the gap so it couldn&#8217;t go rock back to where it was.\xa0 Pushed again, dropped more books in.\xa0 Kept at it, and eventually it tipped.&#8221;\n&#8220;You scared the wits out of some of my colleagues.\xa0 They thought a part of the roof had fallen in.&#8221;\n&#8220;We thought something had escaped,&#8221; a woman&#8217;s voice in the hallway said.\xa0 &#8220;It was like someone had kicked an ants nest, people scurrying around to find out what had gone wrong.&#8221;\nI couldn&#8217;t resist smiling a little at that.\nHayle smiled, though only half was visible through the gap in the door.\xa0 &#8220;Ah, there we go.\xa0 Your expression was so cold I thought we&#8217;d somehow lost you, Sylvester.\xa0 I don&#8217;t suppose you could think up a way to lift the shelf back into place?&#8221;\n&#8220;Probably,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;I could get started soon.\xa0 It would take a while.&#8221;\n&#8220;I was hoping to have you out of there sooner than later,&#8221; he said.\n&#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked, without missing a beat.\xa0 I knew I sounded hostile, cold as he&#8217;d put it.\xa0 I didn&#8217;t care.\n&#8220;Your&#8230; the Lambsbridge gang has asked for you.\xa0 I myself would appreciate your help.&#8221;\nMy eyebrows went up.\n&#8220;I might see if Douglas here can-&#8221;\n&#8220;Why?&#8221; I cut him off.\n&#8220;Excuse me?&#8221;\n&#8220;Why do they need my help?&#8221;\n&#8220;That, Sylvester, is a question I&#8217;m more than happy to answer, but I don&#8217;t feel like detailing it all through a door.&#8221;\nI frowned, reaching up to scratch my head, looking around.\nHopping up onto the back of the bookcase, I approached the door, examining the frame and the door itself.\n&#8220;As I was saying,&#8221; he said.\xa0 &#8220;I could ask Douglas to try pushing on the door-&#8221;\nI seized one of the syringes, paused to set the other one to spinning, just for the heck of it, and headed over to the cot.\n&#8220;-he should be strong enough to move the bookshelf, don&#8217;t you think, Lacey?&#8221;\n&#8220;I think so, professor,&#8221; the woman on the other side said.\n&#8220;Now that I think about it, my concern is damaging the door.&#8221;\n&#8220;It should be okay, I think.&#8221;\n&#8220;Okay, Douglas, come here&#8230;&#8221;\nWhen I glanced up, Mr. Hayle wasn&#8217;t looking through the gap.\xa0 It was probably awkward to keep in that position, right up against the door.\nI put my bare shoulder under the bottom of the cot, using my whole body to lift it up.\xa0 The metal of the cot&#8217;s frame was cold against my back.\xa0 I set the syringe on the floor and slipped to one side to let the cot drop.\xa0 The leg came down to break the glass.\nThe noise made something under the bed move, flying out to the corner by the door and bookcase.\n&#8220;Stop, Douglas.\xa0 Sylvester,&#8221; Mr. Hayle said.\xa0 &#8220;What was that?&#8221;\n&#8220;Allow me one minute,&#8221; I said, absently, picking my way past the pieces of glass.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m sure Douglas could get you out.\xa0 I&#8217;m not sure what you&#8217;re doing there, but if we could minimize the damage and the explanations I have to give my colleagues that are working here in the Hedge, I would appreciate it.&#8221;\n&#8220;Damage is done,&#8221; I said.\xa0 If only to the syringe.\xa0 I shifted my position, lifted up the cot again, and repositioned the plunger-end of the syringe.\xa0 &#8220;I&#8217;ll be fifty seconds.&#8221;\nI imagined him repressing a sigh.\xa0 All I heard, however, was a, &#8220;very well.&#8221;\nA doctor using a syringe had to put their fingers into two metal loops just by the plunger.\xa0 My target was the loop.\xa0 I moved out of the way, and let the leg of the cot fall.\nI twisted and worked the loop until the metal gave way, then raised the cot again.\nUsing my hands, I folded the broken bit of metal in two, for a long length of metal.\xa0 I collected a fallen medical text, and it was heavy enough I could barely hold it in one hand.\nPlacing the long bit of metal on the underside of the hinge, pointing up, I gave it a solid whack with the book.\nThe pin that held the hinge together popped up.\nAnother whack made it pop out.\nThe other hinge was high up enough that I had to stand on my toes to reach it, even with the bookcase under me.\nI gave it the same treatment, and the pin came free.\n&#8220;Okay,&#8221; I said, swiftly backing up, &#8220;Done.\xa0 Push.&#8221;\nI very nearly stepped on the glass from the syringe, before arresting my movement.\xa0 My leg and bare foot stayed up, and I caught my balance, tipping over, twisting, and then throwing myself at the desk with the still-spinning syringe on it, just to have something to grab.\nAround that same moment, someone pushed on the door.\xa0 Without the hinges, it simply tipped forward and fell onto the back of the bookcase.\nMr. Hayle was there, wearing his uniform, including the black lab coat with a hood, and I spotted the red headed woman in the white lab coat, who I knew only as Lacey.\xa0 Shapely, thirty or so, and wholly dedicated to her work.\xa0 Unfortunately.\xa0 I suspected the first-name-only was supposed to endear her to me, but it really didn&#8217;t.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re okay, Sy,&#8221; she said, her voice soft.\xa0 Trying too hard to be gentle.\nMr. Hayle picked his way past the door, stepping onto the back of the bookcase, apparently intent on surveying the damage.\n&#8220;Sir,&#8221; Lacey said, suddenly sounding concerned rather than gentle.\nHe turned.\n&#8220;There were two glass cases in the room.\xa0 They were inhabited.&#8221;\nMr. Hayle froze.\n&#8220;The snake and spiders?&#8221; I asked.\xa0 &#8220;They&#8217;re around here somewhere.\xa0 Something was under the bed.\xa0 It&#8217;s pretty close to you.&#8221;\n&#8220;They don&#8217;t concern you?&#8221; Mr. Hayle asked.\nI shook my head, then wished I hadn&#8217;t.\xa0 It made the general kicked-into-the-dirt pain in my head come back.\n&#8220;I won&#8217;t come any further then.\xa0 If you&#8217;d find a shirt and come out?&#8221;\nI nodded.\xa0 I collected my shirt from the bed and pulled it on.\nAll things considered, he seemed remarkably at ease over the damage I&#8217;d done.\xa0 I wondered who the office belonged to.\n&#8220;Walk with me,&#8221; he said.\xa0 &#8220;Douglas, please listen to Lacey as she instructs you about putting the shelf back in place and catching the smaller animals.\xa0 Lacey?\xa0 Bring him to my office in the tower when you&#8217;re done.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; Lacey said.\nShe reached for me while I passed, and I jerked my shoulder to strike her hand away rather than let it rest on me in anything resembling reassurance.\nMr. Hayle hadn&#8217;t missed it.\nI buttoned up my shirt while we walked.\xa0 I was wrinkled, my hair greasy and sticking out at the ends.\xa0 I might have looked feral.\n&#8220;You don&#8217;t like her.&#8221;\n&#8220;No.&#8221;\n&#8220;I could tell you she&#8217;s a lovely, vibrant young lady, but that&#8217;s not the question, is it?&#8221;\n&#8220;No.&#8221;\n&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think so.\xa0 Let it be what it is, then.\xa0 Tell me, honestly, do you feel up to working?&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;m rarely honest,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;Then give me a convincing lie.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yes, sir.\xa0 If they need my help, I&#8217;ll give it.&#8221;\nHe frowned a little.\n&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; I asked.\n&#8220;The night I dropped you off, I gave them a task.\xa0 It is perhaps the most important job that the Lambsbridge project has been given.\xa0 One only your particular group can do.&#8221;\nHe&#8217;d had my attention.\xa0 Now he had my curiosity.\nHe probably knew me better than I was willing to admit, if he was getting to me this quickly.\nThat, or my defenses were down, and I was giving him more clues than I&#8217;d intended.\n&#8220;I positioned them at the Mothmont ladder school to investigate a problem, and they&#8217;ve run into a block.\xa0 No forward progress.&#8221;\n&#8220;If I&#8217;d known I&#8217;d be going to school I don&#8217;t think I would have helped you move the door.&#8221;\n&#8220;Then let me tell you why you opened the door.\xa0 Three weeks ago, a student at Mothmont killed his father, then himself.\xa0 The victim was a Crown State Senator.\xa0 Autopsies didn&#8217;t indicate any particular chemicals or abnormalities.\xa0 Nine days ago, we had another incident.&#8221;\n&#8220;Another Mothmont student.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said.\xa0 He paused as we passed a pair of students in grey lab coats.\xa0 Graduates.\xa0 The red and silver of the Radham Academy crests they wore on their breasts were stark against the muted fabric.\n&#8220;Hello, professor,&#8221; the girl of the pair greeted Mr. Hayle.\n&#8220;Good morning, Heather, good morning, Daniel,&#8221; he replied.\xa0 We continued walking.\xa0 When they were out of earshot, he resumed his explanation.\xa0 &#8220;A house burned with four individuals inside.\xa0 Charred bodies of a lawyer, his wife, and his politician brother were autopsied, and trauma suggests they were cut with the intent of disabling, limiting their movements so they couldn&#8217;t escape the fire.\xa0 Ankles, knees.\xa0 The daughter of the lawyer was found in a separate room, a Mothmont student herself, but the cuts were different.\xa0 A day later, there was a third incident.\xa0 The day I appeared at Lambsbridge to talk to you.&#8221;\n&#8220;Three makes a pattern.&#8221;\n&#8220;The third incident saw the son murdering his father, grandfather, and mother, the father and grandfather were, again, prominent.\xa0 Military.\xa0 He set fire to the crime scene and sat in the midst of it to burn up.&#8221;\n&#8220;Method?&#8221;\n&#8220;Beg pardon?&#8221;\n&#8220;What was the murder weapon?\xa0 Do they know?&#8221;\n&#8220;The father and grandfather were killed with a sword that had hung over the mantlepiece, both were in their beds.\xa0 The mortician believes the mother fled and tried to fight back.\xa0 She had defensive wounds\xa0 and a weapon of her own in hand.\xa0 She lost the fight.&#8221;\nShe lost.\xa0 That was interesting unto itself.\n&#8220;You&#8217;re sending us after killer children,&#8221; I observed.\n&#8220;I would call them assassins rather than killers.\xa0 You understand the concern here?&#8221;\nWe&#8217;d reached the end of the hallway.\xa0 Mr. Hayle opened a closet and retrieved my cloak and shoes from within.\xa0 I started pulling my outdoor clothes on.\xa0 &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look good.&#8221;\n&#8220;No, Sylvester, it doesn&#8217;t.\xa0 Mothmont was made and supported by rich and powerful individuals with the premise that younger students would graduate from there and move on to the Academy.\xa0 If they couldn&#8217;t pass the entrance exam, they would continue their studies at Mothmont until they could.\xa0 Only the best in teachers, facilities, and students.&#8221;\n&#8220;Except for the parent murdering part,&#8221; I noted.\nWe began our way down.\xa0 There were more students in the stairwell, four men clustered at one window, smoking, two women sitting on the stairs below.\xa0 Both scooted over as we came down.\nOne of the women smiled at me as I descended.\xa0 Twenty and beautiful and wearing a white lab coat that suggested she was still a student.\xa0 Almost an older Helen without the Helen-ness.\xa0 When I met her gaze, my expression flat, her smile dropped off her face.\nMr. Hayle spoke in a low voice, his head turned to make sure nobody above us was listening in as we continued down the spiral stairs.\xa0 &#8220;Being different tends to draw attention, whether it&#8217;s being inferior or being superior.\xa0 Mothmont, being superior, has clearly fallen under someone&#8217;s eye.\xa0 We would like this to stay out of the public&#8217;s eye.\xa0 The only reason it hasn&#8217;t, I believe, is that the third incident happened halfway across the country.\xa0 Given a fourth incident or time for rumors to spread&#8230;&#8221;\n&#8220;&#8230;The cat would be out of the bag.\xa0 I get it.&#8221;\n&#8220;This isn&#8217;t quite like any of the tasks I&#8217;ve given the Lambsbridge project, but it&#8217;s one I feel you&#8217;re suited for.\xa0 That said, it is sensitive, Sylvester.\xa0 Lives are on the line, the people who know and are paying attention matter, and the reactions if others found out could be disastrous.&#8221;\n&#8220;I get it,&#8221; I said, again.\xa0 I knew I was more irritable.\xa0 I had the information I&#8217;d wanted, and now I was finding myself slipping back to the point I&#8217;d been: feeling the ache in my head and resenting everything for existing.\n&#8220;Each major department was given a share of funds to go toward major projects.\xa0 Rather than devote my funds into one project, I devoted them to six very different projects.\xa0 The plan was for the six to form a whole.&#8221;\nI nodded.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate that only four of you proved viable, but you&#8217;ve turned out well, you each show more and more promise as you develop, but you remain one member of a unit.\xa0 A gestalt.\xa0 Your group is feeling your absence, and they feel it strongly enough that they went out of their way to ask for you.&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;m touched,&#8221; I said.\xa0 I wasn&#8217;t lying about that, but my thoughts were more on the fact that I&#8217;d get to rub it in their faces.\xa0 They needed me.\xa0 I could be smug about it.\nWe reached the first floor.\xa0 He held the door for me, and we passed through, heading straight for an office.\nThe grey-coat doctor that had given me fresh skin greeted us, exchanging brief pleasantries with Mr. Hayle before getting down to brass tacks.\xa0 I shouldn&#8217;t spend too long in the sun until a few weeks had passed.\xa0 Never mind that the sun rarely showed its face around these parts.\nMy thoughts were already on the situation at Mothmont.\xa0 I was a week behind the others, and time was already proving to be of the essence.\n☙\nIt wasn&#8217;t Mr. Hayle that dropped me off, but his student Lacey.\xa0 One of three students assigned to me.\xa0 It made for a very quiet, uncomfortable ride to Mothmont.\xa0 I did my utmost to make it uncomfortable for her, glaring at her.\nTo her credit, she seemed to have difficulty meeting my eyes.\n&#8220;Professor Hayle suggested I take you to get your hair cut,&#8221; Lacey said, summoning some courage and meeting my gaze.\xa0 &#8220;So you&#8217;re more presentable.&#8221;\n&#8220;It isn&#8217;t long.&#8221;\n&#8220;It&#8217;s long enough to get untidy very easily,&#8221; she said.\xa0 &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t take long.&#8221;\n&#8220;No,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;Sy-&#8220;\n&#8220;No,&#8221; I said, again.\xa0 &#8220;Don&#8217;t suggest it again.\xa0 There&#8217;s a reason I want my hair like it is.&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; she said, raising her hands.\xa0 &#8220;I understand.\xa0 How about food?\xa0 You barely ate at all after you locked yourself in the office.&#8221;\n&#8220;I ate plenty,&#8221; I said, meeting her eyes.\xa0 &#8220;You didn&#8217;t find all the spiders that had been in the glass case, did you?&#8221;\nShe was stricken with a paralyzing sort of alarm at the idea.\nShe seemed to shake it off, and she managed a titter of a laugh. &#8220;You&#8217;re messing with me.&#8221;\nI looked out the window, and very casually remarked, &#8220;It&#8217;s sort of disgusting when a woman as old as you are tries to giggle and act like a little girl.&#8221;\nI didn&#8217;t look at her to see her reaction.\xa0 That would have taken away from the effect.\xa0 My peripheral vision suggested she&#8217;d reacted as if I&#8217;d slapped her full-on in the face.\n&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me like we&#8217;re friends,&#8221; I said, still not looking at her.\xa0 &#8220;I&#8217;m your job.&#8221;\n&#8220;You seem to have civil conversations with professor Hayle, Sy- Sylvester.&#8221;\xa0 She&#8217;d switched to the long form of my name at the last second.\n&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I said.\xa0 I met her eyes.\xa0 &#8220;I respect him, if nothing else.&#8221;\nThree students had hands-on roles with the Wyvern project.\xa0 With me.\xa0 I had no idea how many were peripherally involved.\xa0 Looking at Lacey, one of the three students, I couldn&#8217;t see any trace of a smile on her face.\xa0 The look in her eyes was a mixture of dislike and pity.\nPity.\xa0 And she wondered why I hated her as much as I did?\n&#8220;I see,&#8221; Lacey said.\xa0 &#8220;Understood.\xa0 Can I ask-&#8220;\nI tensed a little, leaning forward with my hands on my knees, and I heard the hitch of hesitation in her voice.\xa0 A momentary pause.\n&#8220;-Why now?&#8221; she finished.\xa0 &#8220;I won&#8217;t say there haven&#8217;t been incidents in the past, but why are you suddenly taking issue with me today?&#8221;\n&#8220;You can ask,&#8221; I said, and I left the statement hanging.\nShe turned her head, looking out the window I&#8217;d been staring out of a moment ago.\xa0 Apparently she wasn&#8217;t too surprised at the non-answer.\n&#8220;Every day for the last week, you knocked on the door, you tried to talk to me, to reassure, to offer food, sheets or clothes.&#8221;\n&#8220;And you wanted to be left alone?&#8221; she asked.\n&#8220;I did, but that wasn&#8217;t it.\xa0 Give a man a gun, tell him to shoot his neighbor or he gets shot.\xa0 The first man we put in this situation does it without a care.\xa0 He pulls the trigger.\xa0 The second man cries and moans, he begs his neighbor for forgiveness, then he pulls the trigger.\xa0 The third man cries and moans, begs for forgiveness, and pulls the trigger, and the fourth man takes a bullet because he won&#8217;t bring himself to do that.&#8221;\n&#8220;The second and third men are the same?&#8221;\n&#8220;Oh.\xa0 Right.\xa0 The first and second man went home and went to sleep and rested easy,&#8221; I said.\nShe worked through it aloud, summing up, &#8220;First shoots without a word, sleeps easy.\xa0 Second man asks for forgiveness, shoots, sleeps easy.\xa0 Third man asks for forgiveness, shoots, but doesn&#8217;t sleep.\xa0 The fourth dies because he won&#8217;t shoot.\xa0 You&#8217;re going to tell me the first man is the best of the four?&#8221; Lacey asked me.\nI gave her a disgusted look.\xa0 &#8220;No.&#8221;\n&#8220;The third, then.\xa0 You&#8217;re implying I&#8217;m the second?\xa0 It&#8217;s a pretty massive, incorrect assumption on your part, Sylvester, if you think I sleep easy,&#8221; she said, and there was a touch of heat in her voice.\xa0 I&#8217;d upset her a little.\n&#8220;No,&#8221; I said, calm.\xa0 &#8220;I didn&#8217;t say anything about someone being better or worse.\xa0 They can face the situation any way they want to.\xa0 They&#8217;ve got a gun to their head, it&#8217;s their choice.\xa0 You?\xa0 Maybe you&#8217;re like the second man, maybe you&#8217;re like the third, but you definitely don&#8217;t have a gun to your head.\xa0 If you&#8217;re being nice to me, it&#8217;s for your benefit, not mine.&#8221;\nI leaned back, turning away from her, my attention returning to the window.\nHuman nature.\xa0 If I&#8217;d simply said it, one line, one sentence, she wouldn&#8217;t have listened.\xa0 But I&#8217;d gotten her thinking, pulled her in, and then forced her to face it.\nThe remainder of the coach ride to Mothmont was blissfully silent.\nMothmont turned out to be an interesting building.\xa0 Four stories with a steep, slanted shingle roof, it took up a third of a city block, it had no yard that I could make out.\xa0 The walls were eggshell pale, and the ivy that crawled across the brickwork was dark, almost leafless.\xa0 It wasn&#8217;t in an end of town I&#8217;d frequented, but even among nicer buildings with gargoyles that spat out water from the gutters and built-in stables for stitched horses, it stood out as something prominent.\nA woman was waiting for me by the arching entrance that led into the building.\nLacey didn&#8217;t say a word as I left the coach, pulling my hood up to shield off the rain.\n&#8220;Sylvester, I take it?&#8221; the woman asked.\xa0 She was buxom, the word was, businesslike in a pink jacket and short dress, brown hair curled at the sides, with a touch too much makeup.\n&#8220;Yes ma&#8217;am.&#8221;\n&#8220;You have manners.\xa0 Good.\xa0 I&#8217;m the headmistress.\xa0 Let&#8217;s have a look at you.&#8221;\nI pulled down my hood.\nSomehow she didn&#8217;t look particularly pleased.\xa0 I was a little scruffy.\n&#8220;Come, inside,&#8221; she said, guiding me with a hand at my back.\nShe led me in past the front office, pointing me to the boy&#8217;s bathroom.\n&#8220;Uniform on the chair by the sink.\xa0 Take a moment to wash your face before getting dressed.\xa0 I&#8217;ll bring you a comb so you can tidy your hair.&#8221;\nI nodded, and I did as she asked.\nThe uniform turned out to be white.\xa0 White slacks and a button-up shirt with short sleeves and a straight, stiff-necked collar.\xa0 The white of it was likely a nod to the Academy.\nI hated white.\xa0 I&#8217;d seen too much of it, and it didn&#8217;t suit.\xa0 My hair was black, and even with grease or glue or whatever else I put into it, the ends would curl up and it would find a way to break loose.\nI made myself as presentable as possible, knowing it wouldn&#8217;t last.\nI stepped out of the bathroom and presented myself to the headmistress.\xa0 She knelt before me and smoothed out some of the clothing, picking at one piece of lint.\n&#8220;It suits you,&#8221; she lied.\xa0 &#8220;You look like a young gentleman.&#8221;\nTwo lies in two breaths, straight to my face.\xa0 I almost liked her.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s lunch time.\xa0 You can introduce yourself to the others.\xa0 The afternoon classes are all dedicated to biology.\xa0 On Fridays, we visit the Academy.\xa0 Now, a boy named Jamie was staying at the orphanage.\xa0 Do you know him?&#8221;\n&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;\n&#8220;You&#8217;ll be in the same classes as him, and you&#8217;ll sleep in the same quarters.\xa0 You should find him sitting under the tree in the yard, I think.&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised.&#8221;\n&#8220;This is strictly temporary, you understand?&#8221; she asked.\xa0 &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to get your hopes up.&#8221;\n&#8220;I understand, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I said.\nShe straightened, looking down at me.\xa0 &#8220;Mrs. Earles believes you might be motivated to try harder, seeing what we have to offer.&#8221;\n&#8220;I think I will, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;Go on, then,&#8221; she said.\nI went.\xa0 A woman stood by a gate, opening it to let me through.\nThe building formed a square, with the yard in the center, the precious pupils safe within.\xa0 A glass was erected with trees grown to support it at the corners, keeping those beneath dry.\xa0 The glass roof itself crawled with vines and small flowers.\nYouths aged seven to fifteen were gathered within, many playing, or gathered in groups.\xa0 Blankets were laid out here and there for them to sit on, so they wouldn&#8217;t get their uniforms dirty.\nJust as the students of the Academy had possessed a refined, polished air, these students looked proper.\nIt didn&#8217;t take me long to find the others.\xa0 Gordon was in the company of the boys, a larger group.\xa0 Helen was among the girls.\xa0 Jamie was under one of the trees at the perimeter, book and pen in his lap.\xa0 He&#8217;d seen me before I saw him, and was on his feet in a moment.\nLillian, I found off to one side, with an obese girl and a taller, skinny, buck-toothed man who looked to be about fifteen.\xa0 Gordon whistled, sharp, and got her attention.\xa0 She quickly said her goodbye to her two friends.\nWe collected.\nGordon took one look at me, and I saw genuine worry in his eyes.\xa0 &#8220;You had an appointment.&#8221;\nI nodded.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said.\xa0 &#8220;We&#8217;re supposed to be there for each other when it counts.&#8221;\n&#8220;You didn&#8217;t know it was coming.\xa0 I didn&#8217;t either,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;At least I don&#8217;t have to worry about it for another thirty days.&#8221;\nHe looked unimpressed.\n&#8220;You&#8217;re intolerable after an appointment,&#8221; Jamie said.\n&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to be intolerable in a useful way,&#8221; I answered.\xa0 &#8220;Let&#8217;s get down to it.\xa0 I heard you got stuck.&#8221;\n&#8220;Wait, before any of that, did you come alone?&#8221; Gordon asked.\nI frowned.\xa0 &#8220;I got dropped off by Lacey.&#8221;\n&#8220;Damn,&#8221; he said.\n&#8220;We&#8217;d hoped Hayle would come too,&#8221; Jamie said.\xa0 &#8220;I thought he&#8217;d be more concerned at our lack of progress.&#8221;\nI looked between the two, confused.\nGordon frowned.\xa0 &#8220;Look, we&#8217;re more than stuck, Sy.\xa0 We&#8217;re in danger.&#8221;\n&#8220;Danger?&#8221;\n&#8220;They know who we are.\xa0 They&#8217;re onto us,&#8221; Helen said, and her voice was soft and entirely unconcerned.\xa0 That wasn&#8217;t to say there wasn&#8217;t cause for concern.\xa0 It was just Helen.\n&#8220;Five attempts on our lives in the last seven days,&#8221; Jamie said.\xa0 &#8220;And the way we figure it, that means they&#8217;re either very, very clever&#8230;&#8221;\n&#8220;Or rogue elements from the Academy,&#8221; I said.\nJamie nodded.\n&#8220;Talk to us,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;Let&#8217;s hear your ideas, fresh eyes, before we start giving you reason for bias.&#8221;\n&#8220;Alright,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Knowing what little I do, I don&#8217;t think the kids are killers.\xa0 I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re assassins, either.\xa0 They&#8217;re tools.&#8221;\nGordon nodded.\xa0 The others were still.\n&#8220;The killings are steadily improving in quality.\xa0 That suggests the kids are the weapons, and the killer is out there,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;and I think you know that already.&#8221;\n&#8220;We do,&#8221; Gordon said.\n&#8220;What you don&#8217;t know, and why I think you&#8217;re stuck, is that you&#8217;re too prone to patterns.\xa0 You have your own way of doing things, but it&#8217;s too rigid, when your enemies are hiding in the shadows.\xa0 You need to shake it up.&#8221;\n&#8220;You have an idea how, I imagine.&#8221;\nI smiled.\nThe pain in my head was going away by the second.\nPrevious\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0

Next\nOur conversation had to stop for a moment when a group of boys veered our way, kicking a ball between them.\xa0 They circled the tree that was holding up one corner of the glass roof, then headed off toward their makeshift goals.\n&#8220;The lunch hour is going to end before too long,&#8221; Jamie said.\xa0 &#8220;We should hammer out details.&#8221;\n&#8220;Sy&#8217;s idea, making sure we&#8217;re all on the same page&#8230;&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;Okay, that makes sense.\xa0 Sy?&#8221;\n&#8220;Hold on.\xa0 I can change details based on where you guys are at.\xa0 Fill me in, quick.&#8221;\n&#8220;Okay.\xa0 As far as everyone here knows, including the headmistress and the rest of the faculty, I&#8217;m the son of a butcher mogul, Helen is the daughter of a diplomat, and Jamie is the orphan son of a military captain who died and left him some money.\xa0 At Jamie&#8217;s suggestion, the story is that we were all staying at the orphanage as a matter of convenience before our enrollment at Mothmont.\xa0 Favors were called in, whatever.\xa0 It&#8217;s happened before, given the ties between Lambsbridge and Radham Academy, and it&#8217;s not going to surprise anyone.&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;ve been here before,&#8221; Lillian said.\xa0 &#8220;Before I was a student at the Academy.\xa0 Teachers know me, they like me.\xa0 We leaked the idea that I was suspended, and the rules of Mothmont mean I can come back here whenever, to get some classes in, use facilities or brush up.\xa0 I might have to explain to my parents, but I think it&#8217;s okay.\xa0 Nobody&#8217;s asked how I know you guys, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a problem.&#8221;\n&#8220;I suggested the &#8216;ties to the orphanage&#8217; thing because I recognized faces among the students, and those faces have probably seen us out and about as a group,&#8221; Jamie said.\n&#8220;Overall, we have a cover,&#8221; Gordon elaborated, &#8220;Nothing so questionable that anyone&#8217;s going to raise questions.\xa0 But people have a way of taking things at face value, and this situation hasn&#8217;t really bucked the trend.&#8221;\n&#8220;Except for the attempts on your life,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;Except for that.\xa0 But there aren&#8217;t any holes in what we&#8217;re saying that should have raised suspicions,&#8221; Gordon said.\nI nodded.\xa0 &#8220;Mr. Hayle filled me in on most of that, but it&#8217;s good to have the details.\xa0 He said he was intentionally vague about who I was, so I could adapt as the situation required.\xa0 He did say that it was a special favor from the orphanage to work me in later than the rest of you.&#8221;\n&#8220;Really,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 He smiled a little, &#8220;Why would the orphanage be so eager to get rid of you?&#8221;\n&#8220;Because I&#8217;m intolerable,&#8221; I replied, smiling back.\n&#8220;Going by the fact that we&#8217;ve been seen together, and we&#8217;re being seen together\xa0now, who are you, and how do we know you?&#8221; Gordon asked.\nI shrugged, and I was reminded of just how uncomfortable the uniform was, and the spots where it was rubbing against the new skin.\xa0 &#8220;I&#8217;m an orphan.\xa0 We were about the same age, I offered to show you around town.&#8221;\n&#8220;That won&#8217;t go over well,&#8221; Gordon said.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m betting it won&#8217;t,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Scrubby kid with messy hair from wrong side of the tracks.\xa0 I&#8217;ll stick out.&#8221;\n&#8220;Which is your plan,&#8221; Gordon concluded.\n&#8220;In part.\xa0 But before that&#8230; what have you done so far?\xa0 What angles have been covered?&#8221;\n&#8220;Oh, you know me,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;It&#8217;s only been a week and I&#8217;m almost the best student in my class, best at sports, and most can&#8217;t even bring themselves to hate me for it.\xa0 I&#8217;ve been mingling with the top dogs among the boys here.\xa0 Helen&#8217;s done the same for the girls.\xa0 Between the two of us, we&#8217;ve been able to get the word on who the victims were, as well as keep an eye out for who the potential victims might be.&#8221;\n&#8220;Anything conclusive?&#8221;\n&#8220;Less than I&#8217;d like.\xa0 We&#8217;ve asked for extra help to get up to speed with our classes, and that&#8217;s let us keep an ear to the ground when it comes to the faculty.\xa0 There&#8217;s a chance that the person turning children into murder weapons is one of the teachers.&#8221;\n&#8220;Only a chance?&#8221;\n&#8220;Every weekend, students go to the Academy.\xa0 Get a taste of it, keeps them invested in Mothmont.\xa0 Split up into groups based on interest and age.\xa0 Students who were extra good get special lessons with professors.&#8221;\n&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230; messy,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Too many things to cover.\xa0 You didn&#8217;t visit me?&#8221;\n&#8220;I was recovering from being poisoned,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;Lillian was hovering, making sure nobody had reason to get too curious about me.\xa0 That left only Helen and Jamie, and they were busy following up on likelies.&#8221;\n&#8220;Poison, huh?\xa0 I wasn&#8217;t expecting that.&#8221;\n&#8220;That was the most successful attempt out of the three, two for me, one for Jamie.\xa0 One object fell from the roof, almost caving Helen&#8217;s head in, and Jamie very nearly got pushed in front of a fast moving coach while he was on his way to the Academy.\xa0 Helen saved him.&#8221;\nI nodded slowly.\xa0 &#8220;No sightings?&#8221;\n&#8220;They&#8217;re careful.\xa0 And they&#8217;re a they, we&#8217;re pretty sure.\xa0 Plural.&#8221;\n&#8220;Okay,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Starting to get a more complete mental picture.&#8221;\nMy eyes glanced over the collection of youths around us.\xa0 Would there be overt signs?\xa0 They couldn&#8217;t be too obvious, or the others would have noticed.\nWithout knowing more about how the murders were being done, I didn&#8217;t know what to look for.\xa0 We were surrounded, and letting our guard down could be dangerous.\nJamie, maybe thinking I was still hurt that they hadn&#8217;t come for me, commented, &#8220;I looked for you at the Tower, poked my head into Hayle&#8217;s department, to check the labs to see if you were around, and because I wanted to ask a quick question about Gordon and the poison.\xa0 I got word on where you were, but I didn&#8217;t have much time to look around.&#8221;\nHm.\xa0 I probably would have been where Jamie looked for me if I hadn&#8217;t barred myself in the office after my appointment.\xa0 Live and learn.\nThe Tower, Mr. Hayle&#8217;s department opposite end of the Academy campus from the Hedge where I&#8217;d been, was largely focused on research and development regarding the brain.\xa0 Widely viewed as a dead end, the department had defaulted to handling a lot of information storage, memory banks, and files.\nIf Jamie had been there&#8230; I spoke my thoughts aloud, &#8220;Jamie went to the Tower because&#8230; you guys were thinking about mind control?\xa0 Something to do with the brain?&#8221;\n&#8220;We were thinking it could be some neurological manipulation,&#8221; Jamie said.\xa0 &#8220;Helen was looking into hormones and drugs at Claret Hall.&#8221;\nClaret Hall being the center of campus, where students gathered and ate, where key administration facilities were available, and where some of the key elements of the campus and core classes were taught.\xa0 If all aspects of Radham flowed from the Academy, then all aspects of the Academy flowed from Claret Hall.\n&#8220;And you didn&#8217;t find anything,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;If you had, you would have told me.&#8221;\n&#8220;Nothing meaningful,&#8221; Jamie said.\nI nodded.\nGordon&#8217;s head turned.\xa0 I followed his gaze.\xa0 Students were still playing, gathering in groups, but his focus wasn&#8217;t on the students.\xa0 &#8220;More teachers appearing around the doors.&#8221;\n&#8220;Trouble?&#8221; I asked.\n&#8220;In a way.\xa0 We&#8217;re out of time.\xa0 Lunch is over.\xa0 If you&#8217;re going to fill us in, now&#8217;s the time to do it.&#8221;\n&#8220;We&#8217;re close enough to the door that people will see us,&#8221; I observed.\xa0 &#8220;Everyone but Helen, keep an eye on the crowd.\xa0 Don&#8217;t be obvious about it, but keep an eye out for hints.&#8221;\n&#8220;What am I doing?&#8221;\xa0 Helen asked.\nA shrill whistle drew the attention of the various students.\xa0 It sounded again.\xa0 A teacher was signaling for others to come indoors.\xa0 Hordes of students began moving toward the doors.\xa0 Some lingered, like we were, and some were quickly wrapping up their games.\n&#8220;Fix my hair,&#8221; I instructed Helen, &#8220;Give me a kiss on the cheek or something, be tender about it.&#8221;\n&#8220;I like you?&#8221; Helen asked.\n&#8220;You&#8217;re a big sister to me, but actually acting like a normal big sister.\xa0 It can be misinterpreted.&#8221;\nShe hadn&#8217;t quite adopted her deadpan expression, but as I gave my order, her expression changed.\xa0 She smiled, and it was warm.\n&#8220;Your hair is a mess,&#8221; she said, and her voice matched her expression.\xa0 She reached up and fussed with it, running her long fingernails against my scalp as she fixed it up a bit.\xa0 Probably better than I could have if I&#8217;d had a comb and more time.\xa0 She fixed the hair that went from the center of my hairline to my temple, brushing it up and more out of the way, and then let her hand linger, a quarter second too long.\xa0 &#8220;You should focus more on appearances.&#8221;\n&#8220;I should,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;There&#8217;s time to learn.&#8221;\n&#8220;I can always teach you the particulars,&#8221; she said.\xa0 &#8220;If you&#8217;re able to keep yourself in one piece long enough.\xa0 I&#8217;m glad to see you&#8217;ve been put back together.&#8221;\nShe gave me a rub on the arm where I&#8217;d been burned, then leaned close to kiss me on the forehead.\nAgain, her face remained closer to mine for just a heartbeat longer than it needed to.\xa0 With the proximity, I couldn&#8217;t help but think that I found her scarier than I&#8217;d found the snake charmer&#8217;s experiment.\xa0 I knew it was purely my imagination, but I imagined it was how I&#8217;d feel if I was dropped in a tiger&#8217;s enclosure at the zoo, the resident sitting the same distance from me.\nStill, I smiled.\xa0 &#8220;I like me being in one piece too.&#8221;\nI didn&#8217;t look, but I was very aware that of the large group that was filing into the door, a great many boys were paying a great deal of attention to the exchange.\n&#8220;In we go,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Keep an eye out.&#8221;\nWe joined the crowd.\xa0 Gordon took up the rear, guarding our backs.\nI only realized at the last second that him watching our backs was a bad thing.\xa0 A hand reached out in my peripheral vision, and Gordon caught it.\n&#8220;Woah there, Bruno,&#8221; a boy our age said, &#8220;Ease up.&#8221;\nGordon let go of the hand.\xa0 &#8220;Calling me names, now?&#8221;\n&#8220;Just poking fun.\xa0 I&#8217;m a pal, Gordon.\xa0 Relax,&#8221; the boy said.\xa0 He pulled his hand free of Gordon&#8217;s grip.\nThe boy was dark haired, with dark brown eyes, but very much of the same type as Gordon.\xa0 Big, healthy in stature and build without showing a hint of being fat, handsome, and confident enough that he was probably one of the top dogs.\xa0 Between me and Gordon in size, a couple inches taller than me, an inch shorter than Gordon.\xa0 Twelve or so?\nHe smiled at me.\xa0 &#8220;Who&#8217;s slick here?&#8221;\n&#8220;Sy.\xa0 Sylvester if you want to be polite,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;Showed us around before we made our way to Mothmont.\xa0 Sylvester, this is Ed.\xa0 Ed is a good guy to know if you want to know people.\xa0 We&#8217;ve been hanging out.&#8221;\n&#8220;Nice way to put it.\xa0 You mentioned you&#8217;d figured out where things were,&#8221; the boy said.\xa0 &#8220;Hi Helen, Lil, and Ja- James?&#8221;\n&#8220;Jamie.&#8221;\n&#8220;Jamie.\xa0 Sorry.&#8221;\nWe were moving with the rest of the crowd, heading into the school proper.\xa0 I was very aware of those who were moving past me.\xa0 If they were as brazen as the others had insinuated, I wasn&#8217;t sure a knife wouldn&#8217;t find one of us while we were part of this press of bodies.\n&#8220;Tell me about yourself, Sy,&#8221; Ed urged me.\n&#8220;Nothing to tell,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;I&#8217;m nobody important.&#8221;\nReel him in&#8230;\nEd laughed, but it was a laugh for his own benefit, and probably for the others who were watching from a distance.\xa0 &#8220;You don&#8217;t get into Mothmont without being important somehow.&#8221;\n&#8220;Got in on an ask,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;I&#8217;m from the orphanage.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yeah?&#8221; he asked, and there was interest in his voice, with a hint of something else.\xa0 The question had more than basic curiosity backing it.\xa0 &#8220;How&#8217;s that work?&#8221;\n&#8220;Someone liked me, I guess,&#8221; I said.\xa0 I shot Helen a smile.\xa0 She smiled back.\n&#8220;That&#8217;s not really an answer, buddy,&#8221; he said, but there was a bit of a push to the statement.\xa0 Insistence.\xa0 Not just that, but really, &#8216;buddy&#8217;?\xa0 He was acting like he was an adult and I was the kid, but he only had a few inches on me.\xa0 It irritated, and I was feeling particularly irritable.\n&#8220;Only answer I&#8217;m going to give,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;\nI saw a flicker of annoyance on his face.\xa0 He blew a bit of air through his lips, &#8220;Pff.\xa0 I was just being friendly, there&#8217;s no need to brush me off.&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;m not brushing you off.\xa0 I&#8217;m hinting that you&#8217;re butting your nose in where it isn&#8217;t wanted.&#8221;\nEd laughed, again, and I could hear a distinct difference between the laugh now and the laugh just a few seconds ago.\xa0 Tighter at the edges.\xa0 More forced than natural.\nWe were in the hallway between various classrooms, and the crowd was thinning out, which made me feel a little less worried for my own skin.\xa0 The classrooms each had windows between the class and the hallway, and the window frames were grown, large pieces of broken glass collected with what looked like tree branches growing to hold them in place, glass effectively filling the gaps between each branch.\xa0 Past those windows and the classrooms, I could see the yard and the street beyond the school.\nThings were so clean.\xa0 Bright, crisp, all polished and white-painted wood.\xa0 I didn&#8217;t like it when things were this done-up.\xa0 It felt dishonest.\xa0 Nicer people tried to make something look, the less I trusted it.\nA place as nice as this, trying to be classy?\xa0 Murderous students felt like the least of its problems.\n&#8220;Sy&#8217;s usually like this,&#8221; Gordon said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it, Ed.&#8221;\nEd was smiling, but it was a forced smile in the same way the laugh had been.\xa0 &#8220;I&#8217;m not worried, really.\xa0 I just have to wonder about the company you keep.&#8221;\n&#8220;Wonder?\xa0 Why?&#8221; I asked.\xa0 Keeping him talking, talking on his feet.\xa0 I was more comfortable with a fast-moving conversation than most.\n&#8220;You&#8217;ve been given a rosy opportunity like this, kid like you in a place like this, me offering a hand in friendship, and you snub me?\xa0 Not wise, limiting yourself like that.&#8221;\n&#8220;Kid like me, huh?&#8221;\xa0 Force him to justify, put myself apparently off balance, trying to adjust, adapt&#8230;\n&#8220;Kid like you.\xa0 Of less established breeding, no offense.&#8221;\nHe totally meant offense.\xa0 It killed me that he was giving me a golden line like that and I couldn&#8217;t give it what it deserved.\xa0 I had to go easy.\n&#8220;No offense taken,&#8221; I said, smiling.\xa0 There was a teacher not too far away, watching the children in the hallway, making sure her students made their way to her class without dallying.\xa0 I gave my response, smiling at him. &#8220;It&#8217;s funny.&#8221;\nHe didn&#8217;t seem to comprehend.\xa0 Now I had the reins of the dialogue.\xa0 He was forced to ask.\xa0 &#8220;Funny?&#8221;\n&#8220;Someone clearly inbred talking about my breeding.\xa0 It-&#8221;\nHe grabbed me by the front of my uniform and shoved me against the wall, hard.\xa0 Some students around us gasped, stopping in their tracks or forming a loose circle around us.\nThe teacher had noticed, and was heading our way.\n&#8220;Woah there, Bruno,&#8221; I echoed him from earlier.\nHe pulled me away, then shoved me against the wall again.\nThen there was laughter.\nHelen.\xa0 She had one hand to her mouth, and in her attempts to stifle a giggle, she &#8216;accidentally&#8217; snorted.\nEd stared at her.\xa0 There was something raw in the look.\nWhatever else he was, he was still only twelve or so.\xa0 He could be good with words, handsome, smart, whatever else it took to be one of the top dogs of Mothmont, but he was new to liking girls, and he was very conscious of his other friends, who were hanging back, watching.\n&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; she told him.\xa0 &#8220;Really, Edward, I&#8217;m sorry.\xa0 But you have to admit Sy&#8217;s line was funny.&#8221;\nI love you, Helen, I thought.\xa0 She&#8217;d figured out my angle and here she was, supporting me perfectly.\nThe teacher was forging his way through the ring of students.\xa0 Ed had noticed, and he had to save face.\xa0 Had it not been for Helen, he might have socked me one in the stomach and left it be until later.\xa0 But he couldn&#8217;t very well hit me without going against her.\nHe was cornered.\n&#8220;This isn&#8217;t over,&#8221; he said.\xa0 &#8220;We&#8217;re going to continue this later.&#8221;\n&#8220;Are we?\xa0 Easy to say, but so many chicken out.&#8221;\nHe leaned close and whispered, &#8220;After classes, in the corner of the yard, where the two trees will give us some privacy,&#8221; he said, making a show of letting go of my uniform.\n&#8220;I&#8217;ll believe it when I see you there,&#8221; I murmured my response.\nThe teacher broke through.\xa0 Ed pulled away, hands in the air.\n&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; the teacher asked, stern, one hand on her hip.\n&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;All good.&#8221;\n&#8220;All good,&#8221; Ed joined in.\xa0 &#8220;Just playing.&#8221;\nShe gave us a curious look.\xa0 &#8220;Get to your classes.\xa0 Mary, Eliza, I see you talking there, get to your desks, I&#8217;m starting the lesson soon.&#8221;\nHer attention was already elsewhere, gathering up and ordering around kids she knew she had clout with.\xa0 The rest fell in step.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m disappointed, Gordon,&#8221; Ed said.\n&#8220;We can talk later?&#8221; Gordon asked.\xa0 &#8220;Don&#8217;t want bad blood between us.&#8221;\n&#8220;Maybe, sure,&#8221; Ed said, but Gordon wasn&#8217;t his focus here, or even second in his focus.\xa0 The boy left, turning his back to Helen and me as he rejoined friends, hands in his pockets.\nLillian and Helen hurried to their next class, Helen shooting me a smile.\n&#8220;When you set your mind to it, you&#8217;re remarkably good at getting people to hate you,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;Poor sap.&#8221;\n&#8220;Me or him?&#8221;\n&#8220;Him,&#8221; Gordon said, sounding offended at the question.\xa0 &#8220;You and Helen teaming up on him.\xa0 Why&#8217;d you go and do that to him?\xa0 You knew you&#8217;d get someone&#8217;s goat by having Helen be gentle to you, and you did, and then you twisted the damn knife.\xa0 If you wanted to verify that he wasn&#8217;t one of the people who were trying to kill us, you could have asked me.&#8221;\n&#8220;Oh, I wasn&#8217;t thinking that,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;What were you thinking, then?&#8221;\n&#8220;They say when you go to prison, you should murder someone or join a gang.\xa0 Idea is that you want to figure out the pecking order and fit yourself into it somehow.&#8221;\n&#8220;Uh huh,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 He glanced around, noting that the number of students in the hallway had thinned out pretty dramatically.\xa0 We were almost alone, and the students that were around were hurrying.\xa0 &#8220;This isn&#8217;t prison.&#8221;\n&#8220;The hell it isn&#8217;t.\xa0 But that&#8217;s beside the point.&#8221;\n&#8220;Then why bring it up?&#8221; He was quick to retort.\nI sighed, &#8220;I&#8217;m establishing the pecking order.&#8221;\n&#8220;Sy,&#8221; he said.\xa0 He put both hands on my shoulders, leaning close.\xa0 &#8220;I hate to say it&#8230;&#8221;\n&#8220;You love to say it.&#8221;\n&#8220;In all the years I&#8217;ve known you, watching you from the beginning, I have never ever known you to win a fight.\xa0 Or even put in a good showing.&#8221;\n&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say I&#8217;d be at the top of the pecking order,&#8221; I protested.\nGordon stepped back, and he looked at Jamie.\n&#8220;To be fair, he didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Jamie said.\n&#8220;We just got him back, and we&#8217;re going to have to send him right back to the Academy for more medical care,&#8221; Gordon said.\n&#8220;It won&#8217;t be that bad,&#8221; I protested, again.\n&#8220;What are you shooting for, Sly?&#8221; Jamie asked.\xa0 &#8220;Gotta fill us in.&#8221;\n&#8220;You guys stalled because you&#8217;re too safe.\xa0 Were you watching the crowd?&#8221;\n&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 Jamie nodded.\n&#8220;Anyone paying too much attention?\xa0 Trying not to look like they were looking?&#8221;\nGordon shook his head.\n&#8220;A few faces caught my eye,&#8221; Jamie said.\xa0 &#8220;I can point them out later.&#8221;\n&#8220;We shake things up, see what happens,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;What moves, what doesn&#8217;t, what doesn&#8217;t move like it should.\xa0 We pay attention to what comes next, and we might get clues.\xa0 I just happened to draw everyone&#8217;s attention, and whoever was paying attention to you lot is paying extra special attention to me now.\xa0 I&#8217;m betting they&#8217;re confused.&#8221;\n&#8220;I suspect the only person who really gets how you think is you, Sy,&#8221; Gordon said.\n&#8220;Helen gets me,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;Helen is-&#8221; Gordon started.\xa0 &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;\n&#8220;I get it too.\xa0 But you should be ready.\xa0 You might be a target, Sy,&#8221; Jamie said.\n&#8220;I know.\xa0 I expect it.\xa0 You guys have been worrying about knives in the back or poisonings up until now, it&#8217;s only fair I have my turn at it.\xa0 The way and timing of their response is going to be important, so keep your eyes open.&#8221;\nGordon and Jamie nodded.\nWe were getting dirty looks from teachers that were just starting their classes.\n&#8220;Pass it on to the girls?&#8221; I asked.\n&#8220;I will,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;Watch yourselves.&#8221;\nI nodded.\nJamie and I resumed our trek to our class.\n&#8220;He&#8217;s not good at this,&#8221; Jamie said.\xa0 &#8220;This kind of task.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I said, glancing back at Gordon.\n&#8220;His talents don&#8217;t really lend themselves to it.\xa0 Maybe one day, but not today.&#8221;\n&#8220;This is more my domain,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Helen&#8217;s.\xa0 Yours to a lesser degree.&#8221;\nJamie nodded.\n&#8220;Speaking of your domain, what&#8217;s the scoop on the guy I just picked a fight with?&#8221;\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.\xa0 He&#8217;s not in our classes.\xa0 Gordon&#8217;s kept an eye on him, I haven&#8217;t had a reason to.&#8221;\nI frowned.\n&#8220;You&#8217;re not worried, are you?&#8221;\n&#8220;I figured if I had a few choice attacks I could fire his way, I could position myself better.\xa0 I don&#8217;t want to be at the very bottom of any pecking orders.&#8221;\n&#8220;Uh huh,&#8221; Jamie said.\xa0 &#8220;I&#8217;ll find out.&#8221;\nJamie&#8217;s long hair was pulled back into a sailor&#8217;s ponytail, low and resting against the neck, which wasn&#8217;t how he normally wore it.\xa0 It was nearly invisible with his collar up.\xa0 I reached out and flicked it with my finger.\nHe jabbed me in response, which prompted me to bump his shoulder with my own, almost sending him into the nearest classroom door.\xa0 He did the same to me, to less effect.\nThe exchange continued for a few seconds, until he stopped all at once. &#8220;Stop, we&#8217;re at the class.\xa0 They&#8217;ll see.&#8221;\nI immediately fell back into a regular walk, pulling my uniform top down.\xa0 Still in the hallway, we had to walk by the tree-branch window that ran along the length of the classroom to reach the door.\xa0 Jamie pushed his glasses up his nose and fixed his ponytail.\nWhen he was all fixed up, I surreptitiously gave him a jab in the side of his stomach with one of my fingers.\n&#8220;I&#8217;ll get you for that,&#8221; he murmured.\xa0 He opened the door.\n&#8220;You&#8217;re late,&#8221; the teacher said.\n&#8220;The headmistress said Jamie should show me around,&#8221; I said.\nThe woman pursed her lips.\xa0 &#8220;I see.\xa0 Take your seats, please.\xa0 You can sit by Jamie&#8230;&#8221;\n&#8220;Sylvester.&#8221;\n&#8220;Sylvester.\xa0 Thank you.\xa0 Get the notes from Jamie later.\xa0 For now, just sit and follow what you can.&#8221;\xa0 She walked over to her desk and made a note on what I assumed was an attendance list.\nI was very aware of the subtle smiles or glances from various students.\xa0 Ones that had seen Ed pushing me up against the wall, knowing full well that I&#8217;d been stretching the truth.\xa0 My eye quickly traveled over the boys and girls that weren&#8217;t smiling.\nI wouldn&#8217;t be able to remember the particulars, which ones looked like they were trying too hard not to look at me, or who weren&#8217;t.\nJamie would.\n&#8220;Now, back to what I was saying.\xa0 Wollstone&#8217;s ratios are used in seventy percent of what you&#8217;ll be doing if you go on to attend the Academy.\xa0 The golden ratio, seen here, could be said to be the precursor to what would eventually be Wollstone&#8217;s nine ratios.\xa0 With a few quick measurements, we can quickly divine which of the nine ratios is used for a given organism&#8217;s physical structure or composition, and working backward, so long as we can keep to the ratio, we can trust that the organism has the fundamental supports for life.\n&#8220;For example, if you&#8217;ll turn to page seventy-five, we can see where the fundamental pattern of a cat is outlined.\xa0 Keeping to Wollstone&#8217;s &#8216;wise&#8217; ratio, we can discern which parts of the pattern apply to specific parts of the cat.\xa0 Now, it gets more complicated when we decide to alter the pattern, or the how of it, but you should begin to have a glimmer of how a ratio can be used as a shortcut to understanding&#8230;&#8221;\nMy forehead hit the desk.\xa0 I closed my eyes and tried to fall asleep.\n☙\nTo his credit, Ed did know how to throw a punch.\xa0 He knew how to throw ten.\nTo my credit, I managed to stay on my feet until the tenth punch.\xa0 I didn&#8217;t manage to deliver anything substantial in the meantime, but I wasn&#8217;t curling up into a ball and crying uncle.\nThe group of students around us was smaller than I would have liked.\xa0 The Lambsbridge orphans, Ed and Gordon&#8217;s friends, and Helen&#8217;s group.\xa0 Girls for Ed to impress.\xa0 Maybe it would make up for my baiting him, if he got to look good in front of some girls.\nLanding at the base of the tree, I took a second to catch my breath.\xa0 I raised a hand to make Ed stop.\n&#8220;You done?&#8221; he asked.\xa0 &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to say anything about my family again?&#8221;\n&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say anything until you-&#8220;\nI saw him bringing a fist back, ready to hit me again.\nI opened my mouth wide, wincing at the feeling at the corner of my jaw.\xa0 Tight.\nIn the process, I saw a movement in the corner of my eye.\nThere weren&#8217;t many windows that offered a good look at the scene.\xa0 Three trees had been planted at one corner of the yard, between the glass roof and the building, and they blocked the view from many of the nearby windows.\xa0 They also served to keep most of the rain off us.\xa0 Only the girls were wearing hoods and jackets, and I was getting dirty, but not muddy, which was better.\nWe hadn&#8217;t been obvious about our fight, and anyone who had a reason to watch was going to be part of this crowd.\xa0 But, still, three boys had paid enough attention to us to know the fight was happening, and had found one vantage point inside where they could peer past the gaps in the branches and watch what was happening.\xa0 One, thirteen or so, was standing in a way that let the curtain block the lower half of his face.\xa0 The other was far younger, nine or ten, and was leaning forward, hands folded on the windowsill, peering over the bottom of the window to look down at me.\xa0 The third was somewhere between the two in age, and hung far enough back to be hidden in the gloom of an unlit classroom.\nThe look in their eyes was clear enough.\nAs curious as we were about the murderous children, they were curious about us.\xa0 They couldn&#8217;t know me well enough to know how I operated.\xa0 Even Mr. Hayle didn&#8217;t, and he&#8217;d practically designed me.\nEd jabbed me in the middle with the toe of one shoe.\xa0 &#8220;Eh?&#8221;\n&#8220;We&#8217;re good,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Sorry about saying you&#8217;re inbred, Ed.&#8221;\nHe didn&#8217;t look appeased.\nI glanced toward the classroom again.\xa0 The boys were gone.\n&#8220;Come on,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;Let&#8217;s get you looked after.&#8221;\nI nodded.\n&#8220;Saw them,&#8221; I murmured, as he helped me limp on.\n&#8220;Where?&#8221;\n&#8220;Inside.\xa0 Three boys.\xa0 I can give Jamie partial descriptions.&#8221;\n&#8220;Three boys,&#8221; Gordon mused.\xa0 &#8220;That&#8217;s not good.&#8221;\n&#8220;Poisonings are usually done by women,&#8221; Helen said, as she joined us.\xa0 &#8220;Meaning we&#8217;re dealing with four.&#8221;\n&#8220;At least,&#8221; I agreed.\nPrevious\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0

Next\nHow does it go?\xa0 The first lesson, something even the uninitiated know.\xa0 For life to flourish on the most basic level, it requires four elements.\xa0 Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen.\nWe were doing fine on that count.\xa0 The air around us was stale, but it was still oxygen.\xa0 Water ran around and below us, flowing over our bare feet, redirected from gutters to the building&#8217;s inside.\nWhat had once been a barn had been made into a warehouse, then abandoned partway through a third set of changes.\xa0 A floor of old wooden slats reached only halfway down the length of the old building, what had once been a hayloft.\xa0 If we stood on the edge, we could look down at the floor below to see uneven floorboards on top of compacted dirt.\xa0 The original barn&#8217;s door was still there, mounted on rollers.\xa0 I leaned over to get a better look.\xa0 I could see a table, some scattered papers, books, and a blackboard.\xa0 The only light was that which came in through windows.\xa0 A scattered set placed on the upper floor, and more well above head height on the lower one.\nAside from the four of us, one other thing occupied the hayloft.\xa0 It was hard to make out in the dim light that filtered in through the window, like an eel in dark water, and if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that we&#8217;d seen it approach, we might not have noticed it at all.\xa0 Sleek, four-legged, and tall enough I couldn&#8217;t have reached its shoulder if I stood on my toes, it was wound around the pillar as a snake might be.\xa0 Unlike a snake, though, it had four long limbs, each with four long digits, tipped with claws.\xa0 Head flowed into neck, which flowed into shoulder and body without a without prominent ridge, bump, bone or muscle to interrupt the sequence.\nIt uncoiled, setting a claw on the floor, and the old floorboards didn&#8217;t elicit an audible creak.\xa0 Large as it was, it managed to distribute weight too evenly, and used its tail to suspend some of its weight.\nIt didn&#8217;t walk, but slinked, each foot falling in front of the last as it passed within three feet of us.\xa0 Its wide mouth parted, showing just a hint of narrow white teeth.\nThere was no cover, nothing to hide us from it.\nI saw its nostrils flare.\xa0 It opened its mouth to taste the air with a flick of a thin tongue.\nThe way things looked, we were very close to doing the opposite of &#8216;flourishing&#8217;.\nIt was hard to put into words, but my thoughts connected with that thought, and it was funny.\nI grinned, and flakes of wax fell from my face at the movement.\xa0 I watched the thing continue onward, toward the back of the hayloft, head turning as it sniffed the surroundings.\xa0 It unwound its long tail from the wooden pillar that held up the one end of the overhanging hayloft, and it moved with a slow carefulness.\nI stared at its eye, and saw how it didn&#8217;t move as the head swept from one side to the next, the slit of the iris barely changing in response as the faint light from the window swept over its head.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s blind,&#8221; I whispered.\nThe movements of the creature came to a halt.\xa0 It froze, nostrils wide.\nGordon, just to my left, put out a hand, covering my mouth.\xa0 He was tense, lines on his neck standing out.\xa0 Trying to put on a brave face, as our leader.\xa0 Gordon, strong, handsome, likeable, talented.\xa0 A veneer covered his face, as it did all of us, almost clear, cracked and white at the corners of his lips where he&#8217;d changed his expression, coming away in flakes at his hairline, where his hair was covered by the same substance.\nThe creature turned, and as it did its tail moved around until it touched the outside edge of the makeshift gutter that we were all standing in, fine emerald scales rasping against wood.\nWhen Gordon whispered his response, I could barely hear him utter, &#8220;It&#8217;s not deaf.&#8221;\nI nodded, and he pulled his hand away.\nI had a glimpse of the girls.\xa0 Helen and Lillian.\xa0 As different as night and day.\xa0 Lillian was bent over, hood up and over her head, hiding her face, hands clutching the straps of her bag, white knuckled.\xa0 Terrified, and rightly so.\xa0 The coating on her face was flaking badly.\nIn contrast, Helen&#8217;s face didn&#8217;t betray a flicker of emotion.\xa0 Her golden hair, normally well cared for, cultivated into tight rolls, was damp and falling out of place.\xa0 Water ran down her face, splashing in through the side of the window where the makeshift gutter came in, and the droplets didn&#8217;t provoke one flinch or batted eyelash.\xa0 She could have been a statue, and she&#8217;d kept her face still enough that the wax that covered it hadn&#8217;t broken, which only helped the effect.\nStill and silent, we watched as the creature moved to the far corner of the hayloft.\nIt snapped, and the four curved fangs were the only ones that were any wider than a pencil, visible for only an instant before the head disappeared into detritus piled in the corner.\xa0 A furred form struggled before the creature could raise its head.\xa0 No swallowing, per se.\xa0 Gravity did the work, as teeth parted and the prey fell down its long throat.\nA second bite let it collect another, small and young enough it couldn&#8217;t even struggle.\xa0 Tiny morsels.\n&#8220;Kitties,&#8221; Lillian whispered, horror overtaking fear in her expression.\nMama kitty shouldn&#8217;t have had her babies in the same building as the monster, I thought.\xa0 Wallace&#8217;s law at work.\nGordon nudged me.\xa0 He pointed.\nThe window.\nI nodded.\nThe makeshift gutter was little more than a trough, with little care given for the leaks here and there, and it fed into wooden barrels at the edge of the upper floor, with more channels and troughs leading into sub-chambers and tanks below.\xa0 It had been running long enough for debris and grime to accumulate, a combination of silt and scum collecting at the very bottom to make it treacherous.\xa0 Our progress was slow, and I had to remind myself that anything faster threatened to make noise, or risked a fall.\nAs if to follow the thought, Lillian&#8217;s foot skidded on the bottom of the trough, and she tipped forward, straight into Helen&#8217;s arms.\xa0 The creature stopped its slow consumption of the cat&#8217;s litter.\nWe were frozen, waiting, while the creature sniffed the air.\nIt returned to its meal.\nWe made our way out, everyone but me flipping up their hoods to ward off the rain.\xa0 I let the droplets fall where they would, on hair that refused to be bound down beneath a thick layer of waterproofing wax.\nThere was no ledge outside the window, only the real gutter.\xa0 Bigger and more solid, if still treacherous with seasons of accumulated grime.\xa0 The roof loomed above us, more up than over, as barn roofs were wont to be.\xa0 Red leaves collected here and there.\n&#8220;I stay,&#8221; Helen murmured.\nThere was no questioning it, no argument.\xa0 We couldn&#8217;t afford to make the noise, and it made a degree of sense.\n&#8220;I&#8217;ll go first,&#8221; I volunteered, craning my head a bit to see the way down.\xa0 Being the sort of building it was, the barn-turned-warehouse-turned-something-else was tall, with a long way to the bottom.\xa0 The gutter pointed groundward at the corner, fixed to the brick exterior at regular points by lengths of metal.\xa0 It worked as a ladder, but not one that was fun to use.\xa0 The &#8216;rungs&#8217; were too far apart, too close to the wall.\nSomeone grabbed my arm.\xa0 I thought it would be Gordon or Helen, as they had the personalities to be arm-grabbers.\xa0 It wasn&#8217;t.\n&#8220;You go second,&#8221; Lillian whispered to me.\xa0 &#8220;I know you well enough to know that If you go before me you&#8217;ll look up my skirt.&#8221;\n&#8220;Me?&#8221; I tried to sound innocent.\nGordon jabbed me.\xa0 His expression was no-nonsense, his green eyes a steely grey beneath his hood, absorbing the colors of the clouds above.\xa0 His mouth was a grim line.\n&#8220;Okay,&#8221; I conceded.\n&#8220;I&#8217;ll take your bag,&#8221; Gordon whispered.\xa0 Again, there was no argument.\xa0 Lillian handed over the backpack, loaded down with tools and supplies.\nShe accepted Gordon&#8217;s support in getting down to the downspout, and began her slow descent.\nI fidgeted.\xa0 My eye traveled over our surroundings, buildings scattered like they&#8217;d been blown around by strong winds and planted where they lay.\xa0 Older structures had a charm to them, simplicity and a character that came with age and gentle wear and tear.\xa0 The oldest and the newest buildings had been shored up by strategic plant growth, branches weaving into and through damaged sections, growing to complement masonry, around bricks and supports.\xa0 The very newest growths had a characteristic red tint to the leaves.\xa0 The rest were dead, left to petrify.\nThe Academy loomed above it all, those same elements taken to an extreme.\xa0 It had been an old collection of buildings once.\xa0 A rush to grow and meet surging demand had led to a lot of the same haphazard growth.\nIt all had an odor.\xa0 There were smells that became second nature, and there were smells that were ingrained in the psyche as bad smells.\xa0 Ones that spoke of death, of long sickness, and of violence.\xa0 Rendered fat, decay, and blood.\xa0 Each were heavy on the air.\nIronic, that things so overgrown and reeking of decay were the parts of the city charged with progress.\nYou&#8217;d think the rain would wash away the smell.\nI checked.\xa0 Lillian had moved down one rung.\xa0 I shifted my weight from one foot to the next, annoyed.\nShe wasn&#8217;t one of us.\xa0 She was new.\xa0 Allowances had to be made.\nIt wasn&#8217;t the first time I had told myself any of those things.\xa0 I&#8217;d heard it from Gordon.\xa0 It didn&#8217;t make it any less annoying.\nI bent down, peering over the edge of the gutter to the road below.\xa0 I could see the windows, the boxes further down.\n&#8220;Sy,&#8221; Gordon hissed the words, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;\nGripping the ledge, I swung myself over.\nI let go, and enjoyed both the moment of utter terror and Lillian&#8217;s gasp of horror, before my fingers caught hold of the window frame below.\nMy right foot slipped on the damp windowsill, scraping peeling paint off and away before I brought it back up to the sill.\xa0 Water and paint flakes sprayed below.\nWhen I looked up, Gordon&#8217;s head was poking over the edge, looking down at me.\nHe moved his head, and I could hear him speak, very patiently, to Lillian, &#8220;Keep going.\xa0 Don&#8217;t mind him.&#8221;\nPeering in the window, I could see the interior, the lower floor.\xa0 The desk, the notes on the experiment.\xa0 Another table was heavy with lines of bottles, vials, jugs, and yet more papers, scattered.\xa0 Rain poured down on me, tracing its way down the back of my neck, beneath my shirt.\xa0 The waxed and waterproof cowl and short cloak had kept my shirt dry, and I shivered at the sensation.\nI tested the window, and was utterly surprised to find it latched.\xa0 I drew a key from my pocket, trying to fit it into the gap, hoping to lift the latch, but it proved too thick.\nThe key went back in place.\xa0 I removed my hands from the windowsill one at a time, to dry them in my armpits and then reposition my grip.\nGripping the windowsill, I strained my body, reaching down and to the right.\xa0 The doorframe that bounded the large sliding door was just out of reach&#8230;\nHolding the windowsill with my left hand, reaching with my right leg, I touched the frame with my big toe.\xa0 I found a grip, and I used it to better position myself.\xa0 Fingers dug into the space between bricks, where water had worn away mortar, and I heaved myself over, using my toes and only my toes to perch on the top of the doorway.\nWere it any other door, I wouldn&#8217;t have fussed, but I was still just high enough off the ground to have cause to worry.\xa0 This had been a barn, and this door was the type that let wagons or draft horses inside.\nI paused on top of the door, cleaning my hands of wet and grit.\n&#8220;Watching you do that is making me nervous,&#8221; Lillian said, looking down at me.\xa0 She&#8217;d progressed two more &#8216;rungs&#8217;.\xa0 She was the shortest of us, next to me, it didn&#8217;t make it easier for her.\nI flashed her a grin, and more of the waterproofing wax that I&#8217;d caked onto my face cracked.\nI worked my way down to a crouch, still on top of the door, then slid down, draping my front against the door itself.\xa0 I let myself drop the rest of the way, landing bare-footed in mud.\nI couldn&#8217;t get the smile off my face as I passed beneath the drain pipe, making a point of looking up at Lillian, who was making a point of her own in turn, glaring down at me, very clearly annoyed.\n&#8220;You had an audience,&#8221; a soft voice stated.\nI turned.\nAmid empty crates and a door that had been taken off its hinges, jumbled together as trash and detritus, I could make out the fifth member of our contingent.\xa0 Jamie had a book in his lap, our collected boots and shoes neatly organized around him, and he had company.\xa0 A black-skinned boy with a hood and cloak far too large for him, tattered enough that it had probably been a hand-me-down for the last person to own it.\xa0 His eyes were wide.\n&#8220;I thought you were keeping lookout,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;I was.&#8221;\n&#8220;The whole point of being lookout is that you tell us if there&#8217;s trouble.&#8221;\n&#8220;Is he trouble?&#8221;\xa0 Jamie asked.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m no trouble,&#8221; the boy&#8217;s words flowed right off the back of Jamie&#8217;s, without a heartbeat of hesitation.\xa0 &#8220;The trouble is inside.&#8221;\n&#8220;The snake thing,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;You saw it?&#8221; he asked.\xa0 His eyes went wider.\xa0 &#8220;Then you should know if you&#8217;re going to steal something, you shouldn&#8217;t steal from there.&#8221;\n&#8220;We&#8217;re not stealing,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;We&#8217;re just looking.&#8221;\nThe boy didn&#8217;t respond.\xa0 He watched Lillian&#8217;s glacially slow descent.\nI met Jamie&#8217;s eyes.\xa0 If it weren&#8217;t for Helen, who was a special case, I might have called Jamie the quiet one.\xa0 He wore eyeglasses, though there were all sorts of ways to fix or replace bad eyes, and his hair was long beneath his hood.\xa0 Not out of any style or affectation.\xa0 He simply never liked how it looked when it was short.\xa0 His face was narrow, his eyes large as he shifted his gaze to look from me to Lillian.\xa0 His hands held firm to a book that sat across his knees.\n&#8220;Helen?&#8221; he asked.\n&#8220;Stayed upstairs.&#8221;\nA nod.\nI wanted him to figure out how to deal with our bystander, given how he&#8217;d failed to warn us about the boy in the first place, but Jamie was silent.\n&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; I asked.\n&#8220;Mine?&#8221;\n&#8220;I know his,&#8221; I said, striving to not sound as annoyed at the question as I felt.\xa0 I pointed at Jamie to make myself as clear as possible.\n&#8220;Thomas.\xa0 My friends call me Thom.&#8221;\n&#8220;Did you hear about the crying man of Butcher&#8217;s Row?&#8221;\n&#8220;Sly,&#8221; Jamie said, suddenly paying attention to the issue.\xa0 The name was a warning.\nBut Thom gave an answer, &#8220;That stitched that went crazy.\xa0 Remembered things.&#8221;\n&#8220;That&#8217;s the one.\xa0 Do you remember Mother Hen?&#8221;\nThom nodded.\xa0 &#8220;That nurse who- the babies.&#8221;\nHe looked rather uneasy now.\n&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; I said, doing my best to sound calm, reassuring.\xa0 &#8220;The nurse.\xa0 Yes.\xa0 Both got caught, right?\xa0 Everything got tied up neatly?&#8221;\n&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Thom said.\xa0 He couldn&#8217;t meet my eyes, so he focused on Lillian instead.\xa0 &#8220;The authorities from the Academy got them.&#8221;\n&#8220;Exactly, Thom,&#8221; I said, &#8220;But who told the authorities?&#8221;\nHis eyes moved.\xa0 To me, then Jamie, to Lillian, and then the barn-turned-warehouse.\nI was nodding before the word came out of his mouth.\xa0 &#8220;You.&#8221;\n&#8220;You&#8217;re clever,&#8221; I praised him.\n&#8220;Why?&#8221;\nI made the universal gesture for money, rubbing thumb against two fingers.\n&#8220;Really?&#8221;\nI nodded.\nThe gears were shifting in his head.\xa0 Processing, calculating.\n&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard things,&#8221; he said.\n&#8220;I bet.&#8221;\n&#8220;Useful things.&#8221;\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;I can get money for it?\xa0 For telling people?&#8221;\n&#8220;If you know who to tell, and how to sell it,&#8221; I said.\nHis expression changed, a frown.\xa0 Disappointment.\nTick, tick, turn turn.\xa0 The gears in his head were still moving.\nHe wasn&#8217;t dumb, even if he wasn&#8217;t much of an actor.\xa0 Then again, he was only ten or so.\nI could guess what he was going to ask, and I knew I might lose him if I turned him down too many times.\nMy mind ticked over possibilities.\xa0 What I needed, what I had to do.\nBefore he could venture a question, I interrupted him.\xa0 &#8220;You want in?&#8221;\n&#8220;In?&#8221; he asked.\xa0 Now he was wary.\nI reached beneath my cloak, and I fished out a coinpurse.\xa0 Two fingers reached in, and came out fully extended, two dollars in coins pressed between the tips.\nThe wariness subsided.\n&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you this on good faith.\xa0 Eight whole dollars if you follow through.\xa0 I need you to do something for me.&#8221;\nHe reached for and claimed the money without any hesitation.\n&#8220;You said you had friends?&#8221; I asked.\n&#8220;Sure.&#8221;\n&#8220;On top of the grocer&#8217;s place. Corner of Oxbow and Halls.\xa0 Wait there.\xa0 Take turns keeping an eye out.\xa0 You&#8217;re looking for a black coach, led by two stitched horses, heading toward the Academy.\xa0 You&#8217;ll know they&#8217;re stitched because they&#8217;re wearing raincoats.\xa0 Won&#8217;t be more than two hours&#8217; wait.&#8221;\n&#8220;Uh huh?&#8221;\n&#8220;There&#8217;s a rain barrel up there.\xa0 They&#8217;re going to have to stop to wait for the way to clear before they can carry on their way.\xa0 What you&#8217;re going to do is tip over the barrel.\xa0 Send water off the edge of the roof, onto the horses if you can.\xa0 Might want to prop some things up around the barrel, to make sure it happens.&#8221;\nHe frowned a bit.\n&#8220;Ten dollars, all in all, for you and your friends, for one afternoon&#8217;s work.\xa0 Pretty good deal.\xa0 Don&#8217;t think you can do it?&#8221;\n&#8220;I can do it,&#8221; Thom said.\n&#8220;You sure?&#8221; I asked.\n&#8220;I can do it,&#8221; he said, voice firm.\nI studied him, head to toe, taking it all in.\nReaching beneath my cloak, I collected a note from a pocket.\xa0 I pressed it into his hands.\nHe looked down at the money, stunned.\n&#8220;If you don&#8217;t follow through, you won&#8217;t get a deal like this again,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Think hard before you try cheating me.\xa0 A big part of what we do is find people.&#8221;\nMute, he nodded.\n&#8220;Go,&#8221; I said.\nHe went, running, feet splashing in puddles of water.\nLillian was about halfway down.\n&#8220;You lied to him,&#8221; Jamie said.\n&#8220;Would you rather I told the truth?&#8221; I asked.\n&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to get him involved.&#8221;\nI shook my head.\n&#8220;Which leads me to ask&#8230; what are you up to?&#8221; Jamie asked.\xa0 &#8220;You weren&#8217;t just getting rid of him or making trouble.&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;m going inside,&#8221; I said, starting for the door.\xa0 &#8220;Tell the others if they&#8217;re wondering.&#8221;\n&#8220;That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m asking,&#8221; Jamie said.\nBut he didn&#8217;t move from his spot, and I was already gone.\nI passed under Lillian a second time, peeking up her skirt a second time, more to needle her than out of any lingering curiosity.\xa0 The big door was, as it turned out, locked, and I wasn&#8217;t able to bypass the big padlock any more than I could bypass the latch of the window above.\xa0 But the door rolled on wheels, and the wheels fit in ruts, a long, shallow channel.\nI headed to the end of the door opposite the lock, and I pushed the full weight of my body against it.\xa0 The lock rattled, heavy.\nI tried a bit more pressure, pushing, and the door tilted, the bottom corner closest to me rising out of the channel.\xa0 Gripping the door, I lifted it up and away, wood scraping concrete as I created a triangular gap.\nI slipped inside, my eyes immediately going to the hayloft, the upper floor.\nHelen was there, sitting with one foot propped up, both hands in her lap to keep her skirt pressed down.\xa0 Her face was still expressionless.\xa0 Half of her attention was on me.\xa0 Half was on the creature.\xa0 There was a rain barrel beside her, rigged so it hung over the edge of the hayloft, collecting the water that ran in through the makeshift gutter, feeding a steady stream down into containers below.\xa0 Runoff from those containers fed into the corner of the building.\xa0 A drain from when the building had been a warehouse, keeping the goods dry.\nI studied the papers on the desk.\xa0 Water from one of the windows above spat down.\xa0 Barely large enough to qualify as drops, but they dotted one paper, making ink bleed.\xa0 Sketches of the beast.\xa0 Notations on structure and anatomy.\nOne of the texts on a table beside the desk was hand-made.\xa0 Pages had holes in them, and a cord was laced through, tying them to the heavy leather cover.\xa0 With care, I paged through the thing.\nOne being, knit together from several.\xa0 The better traits of each, all drawn together.\xa0 References to Wollstone&#8217;s texts, to the ratios of life, and to the volumes of genetic code for Felidae and Eunectes Murinus.\nA whole chapter on digestive enzymes.\xa0 Diagrams of the thing&#8217;s fangs, which I had glimpsed as it devoured the mother cat, with labels for the reservoirs of venom that wasn&#8217;t true venom.\xa0 It was enzymes, much like the ones bugs used to dissolve their meals before supping them.\xa0 Notes suggested that the feature helped with the digestion of any and all food.\nLittle doubt of what this thing had been engineered for.\nMy finger traced the labels of glass containers, bottles and vials.\xa0 Blood, bile, cerebral fluid&#8230;\nVenom.\xa0 I&#8217;d expected it to be green, but it was clear, in a glass container with a murky exterior, about as tall and wide as a wine bottle, though more cylindrical.\nThere was a noise at the door, and I took a long step to the side, toward the shadows beside one of the big wooden containers for water.\nOnly Lillian, followed by Gordon, passing through the gap.\xa0 Gordon was the largest of us, and it was a particularly tight fit for him.\nI continued paging through the text.\nDiet.\nMy eye traveled down the list.\xa0 Meal times, meal sources, meal sizes.\nPig carcass.\nDog carcass.\nPig carcass.\nScavenged meal, unknown type.\nPig carcass.\nPig carcass.\nScavenged meal, dog.\nIt wasn&#8217;t fully grown, but it was close, and it grew fast.\xa0 Two meals a week.\nI recalled that it had eaten the cat, and then looked back at the entries.\nForty pounds, sixty pounds, forty pounds, est. one hundred pounds&#8230;\xa0 I noted the numbers, and tried to find the pattern between those numbers and the meals.\nI moved ahead a few pages until I reached the first partial page.\xa0 Room left for more entries.\nLast meal, just over two days ago, goat carcass.\xa0 It was hungry already.\xa0 Quite possibly getting ready for one last growth spurt.\xa0 The more recent meals were larger.\nGordon was crouched, peering at labels on bottles.\xa0 He saw me looking, and tapped his nose, then pointed at the bottles\nI nodded.\nI tapped the book, getting his attention, and stepped away while he read the entries.\nHe didn&#8217;t have much of a chance to read.\nThere was a sound outside, violent, of things falling over.\xa0 Chaos.\nI could picture Jamie&#8217;s hiding spot, the way the door had been propped up.\xa0 This was a warning.\n&#8220;Hide,&#8221; Gordon whispered.\nYou don&#8217;t have to tell me, I thought, but I held my tongue.\nVery carefully, I closed the book.\xa0 I shifted the angle to return it to the position it had been in.\xa0 My eye swept over the room.\nWater on the floor.\xa0 Did it matter?\nNo.\xa0 There was no time, besides.\nI slipped into the shadowy crevice between the water tank and the wall.\xa0 Gordon and Lillian were already gone.\xa0 Helen, who had been above, watching everything, was now gone.\xa0 No doubt hiding behind the water barrel, a step away from where she had been.\nFour seconds passed before I heard the lock rattle.\nThe door&#8217;s wheel slammed back down into the rut as it was pulled to one side, but there was no sign of concern or suspicion.\nHe closed the door behind him, and the sound of something being dragged joined the sound of hard shoe soles on the wooden floor, marking his progress across his makeshift laboratory.\n&#8220;Damned beast,&#8221; he muttered.\xa0 &#8220;Where are you?&#8221;\nHe made seemingly deliberate noise as he cleared a table, then dropped his burden on top of it.\nI heard a grunt, his, and the smell of blood filled the air.\nThe amount of light in the room shifted.\xa0 I judged it to be the beast&#8217;s bulk blocking the light from the windows above.\n&#8220;There you are,&#8221; he said.\nWith swift strides, he crossed to the water tank I crouched beside.\xa0 He wasted no time in dipping his hands inside, splashing water as he swished his hands inside.\xa0 Some of the water that slopped around the top of the tank splashed down on top of me.\nI was close enough to touch him.\nThere was a scuffle and a thud as the cat-snake creature touched ground, eager to get to its meal.\xa0 Its creator was already at the desk, picking select vials, dabbing a bit on his wrist, then rubbing his wrists together.\nI thought of Gordon&#8217;s gesture.\xa0 Touching his nose.\nScents?\nPheromones.\nIt was how he controlled the beast he had made.\nI could see him as he tidied papers, only periodically glancing over his shoulder.\xa0 He hummed.\xa0 But for some stubble on his chin, he looked like a gentleman, with a four-button vest under a butcher&#8217;s apron and an ankle-length raincoat.\xa0 His hair was sandy, parted to one side.\nI could see the creature raise its head.\xa0 The meal was in its mouth, and it was angling its head to let it all slide down its gullet.\nIts creator used a pair of tongs to collect a bloody sack.\xa0 I took it to be the sack the creature&#8217;s meal had been in.\xa0 Another pig, perhaps.\nHe disappeared from view.\nA rustle.\nThen the tongs clanged to the floor.\xa0 The beast changed the angle of its head.\n&#8220;A child?&#8221; the man&#8217;s voice was touched with incredulity.\nThere was a commotion, a scrape of steel on concrete as a foot dragged on the tongs.\nI remained where I was.\nThe struggle continued, intermittent, as he backed up, the desk of papers to one side, the table of bottles to the other.\xa0 He had a carving knife to Gordon&#8217;s throat.\xa0 Presumably the same one he&#8217;d used to cut open the creature&#8217;s meal and get its attention.\n&#8220;Two of you.\xa0 Are there more?&#8221;\nGordon was silent.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m asking you!&#8221; the man was angry, outraged.\xa0 &#8220;Are there more?\xa0 Girl!\xa0 How many?\xa0 Tell me or I cut him!&#8221;\n&#8220;A few,&#8221; Lillian said.\xa0 &#8220;Four.&#8221;\n&#8220;The noise outside.\xa0 That was one?&#8221;\n&#8220;Five, if you count him,&#8221; she said, her voice small.\n&#8220;Do not play games with me!&#8221; the man roared.\xa0 &#8220;Show yourselves!\xa0 Each of you!&#8221;\nI exhaled slowly.\nI stepped out of the gap by the water tank.\nHelen was above, at the hayloft.\xa0 Standing by the edge.\xa0 Lillian was closer to the door.\xa0 She and Gordon had been hiding in or near a garbage bin.\nThe beast was relaxed, having just eaten its fill.\n&#8220;Children?&#8221; the man sounded incredulous.\nHe wasn&#8217;t wrong.\xa0 At thirteen, Lillian was the oldest of us.\xa0 Gordon was only twelve as of last month.\n&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Gordon said, his voice strained.\xa0 The man had his throat caught in the crook of one arm, exposing his lower throat.\n&#8220;An infestation,&#8221; the man said.\xa0 &#8220;My experiment didn&#8217;t root you out?&#8221;\nHis eye traveled over each of us in turn.\xa0 I saw the faintest crease appear between his eyebrows.\nHe seemed to come to a realization.\xa0 &#8220;You&#8217;ve covered yourself in something.\xa0 So it can&#8217;t smell you.\xa0 This was premeditated.&#8221;\nI met Lillian&#8217;s eyes.\xa0 I jerked my chin.\xa0 Pointed at her with my hand.\nThe easy, natural interactions and cooperation that followed from years of working together weren&#8217;t there with Lil.\xa0 She was new.\xa0 A recent addition to the group.\nI almost thought she got the wrong idea, until she opened her mouth.\n&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said.\xa0 &#8220;We&#8230; heard about you.&#8221;\n&#8220;Heard what?&#8221;\n&#8220;That there was something loose in the slums.\xa0 It was eating pets.\xa0 It ate a man that was sleeping outside.&#8221;\n&#8220;No,&#8221; the man said.\n&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Lillian said.\xa0 &#8220;There are witnesses.&#8221;\n&#8220;The witnesses are wrong,&#8221; the man said.\n&#8220;You let it go out to find its own food,&#8221; Gordon said, his voice still strangled.\xa0 &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t afford to keep it fed as it grew this large.\xa0 You let it feed on strays.\xa0 Which it did.\xa0 Except one of those strays was human.\xa0 It&#8217;s in the book.\xa0 Meal, unknown type.&#8221;\nI edged around behind the man.\n&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.\xa0 I&#8217;ve studied its leavings,&#8221; the man said, ignoring the label.\xa0 &#8220;Nothing human.&#8221;\n&#8220;Nothing conclusively human, you mean,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;But you aren&#8217;t able to identify all of what it ate.&#8221;\n&#8220;You!&#8221;\xa0 The man raised his voice.\xa0 He sounded more emotional than before.\xa0 &#8220;Up there!\xa0 Girl!\xa0 Stay put.&#8221;\nHelen froze where she was.\n&#8220;You&#8217;re a killer,&#8221; Gordon said, more insistent.\xa0 &#8220;We were calling you the snake charmer.&#8221;\nI edged closer to the table.\nI didn&#8217;t make a sound, but the snake charmer sensed trouble before it arrived.\xa0 He wheeled on me, the knife dangerously close to Gordon&#8217;s throat.\nI lunged in the same movement, seizing the big bottle.\xa0 The venom.\xa0 I held it high.\n&#8220;You don&#8217;t care what happens to him?&#8221; the snake charmer asked.\n&#8220;I care,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;That&#8217;s why, if you cut him, and if it looks like he isn&#8217;t going to be okay, I&#8217;m going to throw this at the both of you.&#8221;\nThe snake charmer&#8217;s eyes darted around.\xa0 He couldn&#8217;t watch all of us at once.\n&#8220;Move!&#8221; he said.\xa0 &#8220;Go around.\xa0 I want you as a group.&#8221;\nI didn&#8217;t budge.\n&#8220;Move!&#8221;\n&#8220;No,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s over, snake charmer,&#8221; Gordon said.\n&#8220;That is not my name!&#8221;\n&#8220;It&#8217;s a name they&#8217;ll give you,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;They&#8217;ll make you a monster.\xa0 It&#8217;s what the Academy does.\xa0 Dehumanizes the dangerous ones.\xa0 You can&#8217;t get all of us, not with the way things are, here.\xa0 Some are bound to escape.\xa0 They&#8217;ll tell people, and those people will find you.\xa0 You know the resources the Academy has.&#8221;\n&#8220;No,&#8221; the snake charmer said.\n&#8220;You don&#8217;t know?&#8221; Gordon asked.\n&#8220;This is not my fault,&#8221; the snake charmer said.\xa0 &#8220;The Academy&#8230; this rests on their shoulders, not mine.\xa0 You can&#8217;t enroll without showing your skill, and you can&#8217;t show your skill without experimenting, but oh, no, they don&#8217;t allow that, do they?&#8221;\n&#8220;There are ways,&#8221; Lillian said.\n&#8220;No!&#8221; the man barked, &#8220;No!\xa0 Not nearly enough.\xa0 The world is changing, and they&#8217;re deciding the course.\xa0 They&#8217;re putting us in this situation, where risks have to be taken.\xa0 Gambles have to be made, or history will continue to be made, names attached to great discoveries, and the rest of us?\xa0 If we&#8217;re lucky, we get left by the wayside.\xa0 If we&#8217;re not, we&#8217;re just fuel for what they&#8217;re setting in motion.&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;m a student there,&#8221; Lillian said.\xa0 &#8220;I just started, but&#8230; I&#8217;m enrolled.\xa0 First year of study.\xa0 Not them.\xa0 Just me.&#8221;\nI could see the man&#8217;s expression twist.\xa0 Incomprehension.\xa0 Comprehension, which was almost worse.\xa0 Hatred for a thirteen year old girl.\nThen rage, not a clean, pure kind, but one that only drove him further into a corner.\nHis hand tightened on the grip of the knife.\nI figured out the destination he was arriving at before he did.\nI arrived at my own, and I mustered up some courage.\nVery deliberately, I grunted, heaving the bottle of acid at the snake charmer.\nHe heard the grunt, but so did Gordon.\xa0 With the snake charmer&#8217;s attention caught between Lillian and me, Gordon found a chance to protect his throat, keeping the knife from cutting.\nThe bottle flew lazily through the air.\xa0 Gordon ducked, head down, and the snake charmer released him.\nThe man caught the bottle in a bear hug.\nHe stared down at the container.\nAll the same emotions he&#8217;d felt for Lillian, now aimed at me, progressing much faster this time.\xa0 Incomprehension, comprehension, hatred, rage.\nDirected at me.\nI backed away, stumbling, falling.\xa0 I covered my face as he swung, using the waterproof cloth to try and shield my body.\nHe didn&#8217;t throw at me, but at the floor.\xa0 The chance of me catching it was small, but by throwing it at the floor, he could guarantee that the bottle would shatter into a spray I couldn&#8217;t possibly shield all of myself from.\nThe pain was sharp, at first, droplets touching skin, immediately breaking it down.\xa0 Then it burned.\nThe horrible coldness was worse, because it suggested dying nerves.\xa0 All down my arms, and one side of my face.\nI screamed.\nThe creature turned its head, but didn&#8217;t move.\nThe man turned, wheeling on the others.\xa0 Gordon was ready, already closing in, taking advantage of the short moment it took the snake charmer to adjust his grip on the knife, so soon after heaving the bottle.\nA tackle, shoulder into the man&#8217;s gut, taking advantage of smaller size and a good physique.\xa0 Gordon drove the man back.\nGordon was the hero, golden haired, noble, likeable.\xa0 Talented.\nWhen he broke away, letting the snake charmer stumble back two steps, recovering balance, Gordon had the knife in hand.\nThe beast rose to its feet.\xa0 Sniffing.\nI managed to stop screaming, going as still as possible.\nIt still edged closer to me.\xa0 Interested.\nStill hungry,\xa0 I noted.\nHelen acted.\xa0 Tipping over the barrel.\nDrenching the snake charmer, washing away his charm, the pheromones.\n&#8220;Brats!&#8221; the snake charmer spat the word.\xa0 &#8220;You little shits!\xa0 You think you have control of this situation?&#8221;\n&#8220;Your experiment is trying to decide between you and Sylvester over there,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;You smell, he&#8217;s bleeding.\xa0 Both are tempting.&#8221;\nThe snake charmer made an incoherent noise.\n&#8220;Thing is, if you start bleeding&#8230;&#8221; Gordon said, trailing off.\xa0 &#8220;You&#8217;ll suddenly be a lot more tempting.&#8221;\n&#8220;Try it,&#8221; the snake charmer said.\nGordon did.\xa0 He approached, and the snake charmer tried to grab him.\nThe man&#8217;s hands only grabbed clothes.\xa0 A hood and cloak meant to keep the rain off.\xa0 Gordon let him, and ducked low, the clothing bunching up around his neck and upper chest.\nGordon sliced the snake charmer&#8217;s stomach.\xa0 A shallow cut.\nAnother grab, wrestling Gordon, trying to overpower with strength, seizing one arm.\nGordon let the knife drop out of one hand, falling into the palm of another.\nHe cut the back of the man&#8217;s left knee.\xa0 When the man fell, screaming, Gordon cut the other knee.\xa0 He skipped back as the snake charmer fell.\nThe snake stirred, its attention no longer predominantly on me.\nI could see the snake charmer realizing the same thing I had minutes ago.\xa0 He knew his experiment.\xa0 He knew how it hunted.\xa0 It scavenged, sniffing out prey.\xa0 Blind, it reacted to noise and smell.\xa0 Minimizing the noise one made was vital.\nGiven the situation, however, staying silent spelled the man&#8217;s doom.\xa0 Already, his creation was sniffing him out.\xa0 He smelled of blood.\n&#8220;Pheromones,&#8221; he said, knowing how dangerous it was to speak, that every sound helped him lose the tug of war that let the creature decide between devouring him and devouring me.\xa0 &#8220;Let me- I&#8217;ll come with you.\xa0 You can take me in.\xa0 You win.&#8221;\nNobody moved or responded.\nHe used his arms to pull himself forward, progressing toward the table.\xa0 Each motion drew more attention from his beast.\nFoot by foot, he closed on the table, and each sound was akin to a fisherman&#8217;s line, reeling in the beast.\nHe reached the table, struggling, and he raised himself up, using one hand to drag a leg forward, propping it under him.\xa0 Reaching across the table-\nGordon kicked the leg of the table, hard.\xa0 The table shifted a foot, and the snake charmer collapsed.\n&#8220;No.\xa0 Please.&#8221;\nThe snake charmer looked at us.\xa0 At Gordon, then Helen, who loomed above, perched on the hayloft.\xa0 At me, as I glared at him, my face burned.\xa0 At Lillian, who was sitting in the corner, hands over her head.\nWho was not one of us.\n&#8220;Please,&#8221; he said.\xa0 &#8220;Not like this.&#8221;\nHelen&#8217;s expression didn&#8217;t change.\xa0 Gordon shifted his position, placing himself between the snake charmer and the table, arms folded.\xa0 I remained where I was, limp and breathing hard.\nI could see it dawn on the man.\xa0 Comprehension settling in as he realized what he was dealing with.\nThe snake seized the man&#8217;s feet, and began the very slow process of swallowing him.\nThe snake charmer&#8217;s screams became frantic.\n&#8220;Lillian,&#8221; Gordon said, raising his voice to be heard over the screams.\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see.&#8221;\n&#8220;Then shield your eyes.\xa0 But your job is to keep us in one piece.\xa0 Sly is hurt.\xa0 Focus, and make sure he doesn&#8217;t die.&#8221;\nI felt the burning stop as Lillian tended to me.\xa0 By the time she was done, the screams had stopped.\xa0 The powder that dusted me made it hard to see, but that was fine.\xa0 I was lifted to my feet.\n&#8220;I have to say, I&#8217;m very interested in what the fuck you were doing, faking that fall, setting yourself up to get hurt just now,&#8221;

Jamie said.\xa0 &#8220;Um&#8230;&#8221;\nHe turned a page in his notebook.\nOn the fresh page, he began to sketch.\xa0 He was using a fountain pen that flowed fairly freely, but his hand moved with some speed and dexterity.\xa0 It was interesting to see, because Jamie wasn&#8217;t a strong artist.\xa0 He made my eyes too small, the position slightly wrong, paused, then went back, expanding, making the top of the eye into my eyebrows, and drawing my eyes at a larger size.\xa0 It was a rough sketch, and it was a sketch that showed my face in heavy shadow, the lines noticeable, thick.\nAt first I took it for a caricature, exaggerating my features, but Jamie wasn&#8217;t good enough to do that.\xa0 The hair was drawn in messy, framing it all, and the lines marked my cheeks as being more gaunt, with thin cross-hatching for the shadows in the recesses, I realized that it wasn&#8217;t a recent picture, that my eyes were larger in proportion to the rest because it was a picture of me, years younger.\nNear the beginning.\nDrawing from memory, rather than talent.\nI leaned forward, and it was as though I were looking into a mirror cast in paper.\xa0 My eyes were narrow, my lips thin and slightly parted, and all the features of my face and ears were fine to the point of being sharp.\nJamie was already putting down notes below and to the side of the image.\xa0 I glanced at the first.\nDrawn for a discussion with Sly, during the Case of the Bad Seeds.\n&#8220;Case of the bad seeds,&#8221; I commented idly.\n&#8220;Placeholder,&#8221; he said.\xa0 He was already going on to write more.\xa0 Normally I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to resist reading over his shoulder, but I found I couldn&#8217;t keep my eyes off the image for long.\xa0 The eyes were just scratches of black ink, almost hidden in the shadows that had been etched around them, but they took up much of the focus.\n&#8220;This was&#8230; that time I had to do two appointments, back to back?&#8221;\xa0 I asked.\xa0 Only time my cheeks would have been that hollow.\nJamie didn&#8217;t respond, but his pen moved, indicating a line he&#8217;d just jotted down.\xa0 He tapped his fountain pen against paper, leaving three blotchy dots in the margin.\nFrom memory: Sly in the Tower, after he ran away.\xa0 Before he recovered from one month&#8217;s appointment, he had to do the next.\nReading the line, I suddenly felt excruciatingly uncomfortable, and the hour-old bruises from my encounter with Ed weren&#8217;t why.\xa0 Feeling so restless I couldn&#8217;t bear it, I turned away from Jamie, his chair, and his book, and I paced across our little dorm room.\xa0 Two beds each with a chest at the foot, one desk, and one bedside table between the beds with drawers for us to share.\xa0 Mothmont was fancy, but not so fancy that we each got a palace.\xa0 Real estate mattered, if nothing else.\n&#8220;We didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d get you back,&#8221; Jamie murmured.\xa0 &#8220;We suspected you were lost.&#8221;\n&#8220;That&#8217;s not it,&#8221; I said, forcing my voice to sound different from how I felt.\xa0 I worried I didn&#8217;t sell it very well.\xa0 &#8220;No.\xa0 It&#8217;s not like Helen is, and it&#8217;s not like that, okay?\xa0 That&#8217;s not the look they had.&#8221;\n&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Jamie said, sounding very normal, placid, and very calm.\nThough I didn&#8217;t like it, I was finding the conversation helped me to clarify my interpretation.\xa0 &#8220;They weren&#8217;t lost.\xa0 There was emotion there.\xa0 They were human, but they weren&#8217;t nice humans.&#8221;\n&#8220;You&#8217;re not a nice human sometimes,&#8221; Jamie remarked.\nI shot him a look.\n&#8220;Only saying, Sly, only saying.&#8221;\n&#8220;I looked at them, and I knew they were the sorts who&#8217;d stick their parents with something sharp and then light up the family home.\xa0 Or try to drop a piece of masonry on someone they didn&#8217;t like.&#8221;\n&#8220;You&#8217;d-&#8221;\nI narrowed my eyes, making the look darker and more intense.\nHe seemed to give up, pulling his hands away from the page, slumping back.\xa0 &#8220;Yeah, Sy.\xa0 Got it.\xa0 But if you can&#8217;t tell me how\xa0they looked all murderous, I&#8217;m not sure I can draw it.\xa0 I&#8217;m not sure I can draw them in the first place.&#8221;\n&#8220;It&#8217;s fine,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Don&#8217;t fret about it.&#8221;\n&#8220;Think you&#8217;d recognize them if you saw them?&#8221;\n&#8220;If I saw them?\xa0 No.\xa0 They were standing in shadow.\xa0 If I talked to them, maybe.&#8221;\n&#8220;There are one thousand, two hundred students at Mothmont, give or take, ranging from year one to year twelve.\xa0 It&#8217;s going to take you an awful long time to talk to them all.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I said.\xa0 I was still on the far side of the room.\xa0 Three sets of my uniform had been provided, alongside a little cloak and hood for the rain and an umbrella, all stacked neatly on the chest at the end of the bed.\xa0 My bedside drawer had a new comb, bottle of toothwash, washcloth, and a new set of books.\nNothing that was mine.\xa0 I didn&#8217;t like it.\xa0 The office back at the hedge with the grille on the windows and the bookcase blocking the door had felt less like a cell than this.\nThere, I&#8217;d been free to be me.\xa0 Here, I was being made to conform, just like some of the fruit I&#8217;d seen grown at the Academy, placed inside molds that would shape their growth.\xa0 Fruit shaped like certain animals, or like human faces.\nWere our murder-children in that same situation?\nI frowned.\xa0 &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking&#8230;&#8221;\n&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;\xa0 Jamie twisted in his seat, elbow over the back of the chair.\n&#8220;Why here?&#8221; I asked.\n&#8220;Resources are available, on multiple fronts.\xa0 You&#8217;ve got access to children, you&#8217;ve got access to tools and starter labs.\xa0 Maybe things go missing, maybe it gets put back at the end of the day?&#8221;\n&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;One way or another, something is going on with their heads.\xa0 Either they&#8217;re being made to do something they normally wouldn&#8217;t, or they&#8217;re not them, and something more nefarious is going on.&#8221;\n&#8220;Nefarious?&#8221;\n&#8220;There are parasites that induce suicidal behavior in the host as part of the life cycle.&#8221;\n&#8220;Sure.\xa0 Transoplasma Felidae.\xa0 Feverish behavior and a compulsion to drown oneself.\xa0 Weaponized version was Transoplasma Necis, but that saw reams of people biting off their own tongues to choke on the tongue or aspirating the blood.\xa0 Well known enough.&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;ll take your word for it.\xa0 Maybe the students we&#8217;re talking about have a parasite in their heads, something that&#8217;s making them act funny.\xa0 Maybe we&#8217;re dealing with the parasites and not the children themselves.&#8221;\nJamie seemed to consider a moment.\xa0 &#8220;Raises questions.&#8221;\n&#8220;You ask, I try to justify.&#8221;\n&#8220;Why do they care about us?&#8221;\n&#8220;They&#8217;re complex.\xa0 Pre-set instructions.&#8221;\nJamie shook his head.\xa0 &#8220;I don&#8217;t buy that someone capable of that would be here and not at the Academy, making a fortune.&#8221;\n&#8220;Then they&#8217;re paranoid.\xa0 Like they&#8217;re rabid, they&#8217;re wary of everything.&#8221;\n&#8220;Why us?&#8221;\nI started to come up with an explanation, then dismissed it.\xa0 Felt weak, like too much of a reach.\xa0 &#8220;What if it made them suggestible?\xa0 Broke down the walls in their heads, left them open to receiving instruction?\xa0 Get access to the children, slip them something that leaves them open to being influenced.&#8221;\n&#8220;We&#8217;d see it in their behavior,&#8221; Jamie said.\n&#8220;What?\xa0 That they&#8217;d be willing to take orders?\xa0 Follow the rest of the sheep?\xa0 We&#8217;re in a school, Jamie,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;Point.&#8221;\n&#8220;A highbrow school.\xa0 Look, I&#8217;m not sold on the parasite idea.\xa0 But we&#8217;ve got an awful lot of children here, ones that might be more vulnerable to whatever, or of an age where some symptoms might be easier to hide.\xa0 Maybe the fact that we&#8217;re all fitting into some cookie cutter archetype is an advantage for our puppeteer in the background.\xa0 If their little experiments feel disoriented?\xa0 Have lost memories?\xa0 If their behavior is a little outside the norm?\xa0 All our &#8216;bad seed&#8217; has to do is imitate their peers.&#8221;\nJamie was nodding, already thinking the idea through, rounding it out, &#8220;If they act too far out of line, then the faculty steps in, gets them to shape up.\xa0 If that fails&#8230;&#8221;\n&#8220;What happens when someone futzes up and doesn&#8217;t look like they&#8217;re going to straighten out?&#8221;\n&#8220;Detention,&#8221; Jamie said.\xa0 &#8220;Or a talk with the headmistress.\xa0 You don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s the one doing it?&#8221;\nI rolled my head to one side, then the other.\xa0 &#8220;I talked to the woman.\xa0 I didn&#8217;t get that sense out of her.&#8221;\n&#8220;Why?&#8221;\nI gave Jamie an annoyed look.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s good to think about why,&#8221; Jamie said, his voice quiet but not meek.\xa0 &#8220;You have a good sense of things, but it&#8217;s important to identify the details that are feeding into that sense.\xa0 You see little details, and your brain picks them up and puts them into storage, while your conscious mind doesn&#8217;t register them.\xa0 Prey animals use that low-level awareness a lot, figuring out that a predator could be nearby, and we still have traces of that prey thinking.&#8221;\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t see myself as a prey animal,&#8221; I said, smiling.\n&#8220;The idea is sound, Sy.\xa0 We all use that sense to some extent, but you&#8217;re a little better than most.\xa0 You can train it, but training it starts with being aware.\xa0 Think about your surroundings, pay attention to the details, and-&#8221;\nA knock sounded at the door.\n&#8220;You two decent in there?&#8221; Gordon asked, voice muffled by the intervening door.\n&#8220;Am I ever decent?&#8221; I asked.\nThe door opened.\xa0 But it wasn&#8217;t just Gordon, which surprised me.\xa0 He was accompanied by a boy, narrow in build, with thick eyebrows and wiry black hair cut a finger&#8217;s width from his head.\xa0 It didn&#8217;t look like one of the boys that would be in Gordon&#8217;s cadre.\n&#8220;We ran into each other at the door,&#8221; Gordon said.\n&#8220;I know him,&#8221; Jamie said.\xa0 &#8220;Book trade?&#8221;\n&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; the boy said.\xa0 He held out two dime novels.\xa0 &#8220;Read them?&#8221;\nJamie glanced at the novels, &#8220;Yes.\xa0 But it&#8217;s fine.\xa0 I&#8217;ll trade.&#8221;\nHe opened a drawer in the desk, pulling out five more dime novels.\xa0 &#8220;Doll Man and the song of the moon?&#8221;\n&#8220;Read it.&#8221;\n&#8220;Doll man and the revenge of the swarm queen?&#8221;\n&#8220;That&#8217;s out?&#8221;\xa0 The boy stuck out his hand.\xa0 Jamie dutifully handed over the book, no more than a hundred pages.\n&#8220;I liked this one,&#8221; Jamie said, &#8220;But you might want to wait until there&#8217;s more material.&#8221;\n&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; the boy asked.\n&#8220;Huh?&#8221; Jamie asked.\nI turned, and I started to cross the room, before I saw Gordon moving in the same direction.\xa0 He was faster, and he was closer.\xa0 I deferred to him.\nBefore Jamie was able to process just what had grabbed the boy&#8217;s attention, Gordon touched the cover of Jamie&#8217;s notebook and flipped it over.\xa0 It slapped closed and slid a bit across the desk.\nJamie put a hand out to stop it.\n&#8220;That&#8217;s Jamie&#8217;s journal,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;You don&#8217;t read someone&#8217;s journal, pal.&#8221;\n&#8220;Oh,&#8221; the boy said.\xa0 He turned a little pink.\xa0 &#8220;Didn&#8217;t know, sorry Jamie.&#8221;\n&#8220;It&#8217;s okay,&#8221; Jamie said.\n&#8220;That picture was something.\xa0 Scary, if I can say so,&#8221; the boy said, turning to look at me.\xa0 &#8220;That was you?&#8221;\n&#8220;You don&#8217;t comment on someone&#8217;s journal if you happen to get a look at it, either,&#8221; Gordon said, his voice firm.\nThe boy&#8217;s face turned even pinker.\n&#8220;Mickey,&#8221; Jamie said, offering a bit of relief where I would have pressed the advantage. &#8220;Take a look.&#8221;\nJamie held the other three little novels so they fanned out.\xa0 A lady in white and a rat crawling out of the darkness, a man with a bird mask, and a handsome young man with a dog accompanying him through a forest.\n&#8220;What&#8217;s that last one?&#8221; Mickey asked.\nJamie pulled it away before Mickey could grab it.\xa0 &#8220;When we stopped by the Academy last weekend, you see anyone go off in a very small group?&#8221;\n&#8220;Very small?&#8221;\n&#8220;More than three, less than ten.&#8221;\n&#8220;Uh.\xa0 Some special students got instruction with professors, or got to sit in on classes.\xa0 Top of certain classes, or something.\xa0 But they were alone.&#8221;\n&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Jamie said.\n&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;\n&#8220;Okay, thanks anyway,&#8221; Jamie said.\xa0 He put the books down, then handed over the one Mickey had expressed interest in.\xa0 &#8220;Barber John and the dark forest monster.&#8221;\n&#8220;Keen.&#8221;\nGordon stepped out of the way while the boy headed back to the hallway.\xa0 He closed the door behind him, and stood with his back to it.\xa0 &#8220;Asking questions like that can draw attention.&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;m very careful about who I ask,&#8221; Jamie said.\n&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 He seemed to take that at face value.\xa0 He didn&#8217;t mention Jamie&#8217;s lapse about the book.\nGordon and I wouldn&#8217;t go after Jamie for that any more than any of the others would come after me for my behavior after an appointment.\xa0 We had our strengths, and we had our individual weak points.\xa0 If everything was working as it should, we covered the weak points and highlighted the strengths.\nThat meant accepting that sometimes Jamie had enough stuff in his head that he was a little slower to get things rolling when surprised.\nIf I&#8217;d been on the ball, I would have reminded Jamie, but my head hurt.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s time for dinner,&#8221; Gordon said.\xa0 &#8220;Thought I&#8217;d check in.&#8221;\n&#8220;Still alive,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;No surprise murders.&#8221;\nGordon&#8217;s expression didn&#8217;t twitch.\xa0 &#8220;What do you think?&#8221;\n&#8220;We were thinking maybe the structure of the school is being used to shape or correct behavior where it might go off rails,&#8221; Jamie said.\xa0 I cleared my throat, and Jamie amended his statement to say, &#8220;Sy thought so.\xa0 It makes some sense.&#8221;\n&#8220;Something to watch out for?&#8221; Gordon asked.\n&#8220;Quirks in behavior, students pushing the limit and getting pushed back in line by the group,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;And it might be worth seeing who is in charge of correcting the students when they get too problematic.&#8221;\nGordon nodded.\xa0 &#8220;Our mad doctor or doctors act the role of the murderer, the children are the murder weapon, and that weapon needs to be kept controlled and concealed.\xa0 The school is a setting for it.\xa0 That still leaves questions.\xa0 Who, how, why.&#8221;\n&#8220;Who is the murderer, how are they doing this with the students, and why are they doing it?\xa0 What&#8217;s the motive?&#8221; Jamie asked.\n&#8220;How, also, are they giving orders?&#8221; Gordon asked.\xa0 &#8220;The students here got orders to kill us.\xa0 When?\xa0 What form did it take?&#8221;\n&#8220;Food for thought,&#8221; I said.\xa0 I perked up.\xa0 &#8220;Speaking of food&#8230;&#8221;\n&#8220;That was contrived,&#8221; Gordon said.\n&#8220;Brain feels sluggish, and I haven&#8217;t had an actual meal in&#8230;&#8221; I counted on my fingers, then paused, stuck.\xa0 &#8220;When did we eat, before the snake charmer?&#8221;\nGordon blinked.\xa0 &#8220;At that point, I think the question is academic.\xa0 Have you had water?&#8221;\n&#8220;I had some water, yeah,&#8221; I said.\nHe frowned.\xa0 &#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t, I&#8217;d wonder how you were still standing.\xa0 Let&#8217;s slap a feedbag on that face of yours, Sy.\xa0 And you wonder why you&#8217;re short.&#8221;\nI grabbed the comb from the bedside table and hucked it at his head.\xa0 He caught it, which didn&#8217;t surprise me.\nWe collected ourselves, getting our things.\xa0 Jamie picked up his notebook, tucking it under one arm.\xa0 The pen was capped and slipped into a breast pocket.\xa0 Gordon was all set up, and all I needed was a bit of protection from any rain.\nThe school was arranged into a square, with the yard in the middle.\xa0 The front entrance sat at the southern wall with the front office, infirmary and other administrative rooms.\xa0 The west and east sides of the square had classrooms.\xa0 The more interesting area was the northern end, furthest from the entrance.\xa0 Here, we had the dorms, boys at the west corner, girls at the east.\xa0 The two sides of the dorms were separated by the teacher&#8217;s quarters and washrooms on the upper floors, and a spacious dining room on the lower floor.\xa0 I supposed the idea was that it made mingling harder.\nThe dorms were ordered by year, with the older students on the upper floors, and being right in the upper-middle of the range of ages, we were left to make our way down on our way to the dining room.\nMy eyes searched the crowd, looking for a familiar face or feature.\xa0 I&#8217;d told Jamie I wasn&#8217;t sure if I could place them, but that didn&#8217;t stop me from trying.\xa0 Kids milled around us.\n&#8220;Ed was asking about you, before your little tussle under the tree,&#8221; Gordon commented.\xa0 Keeping the conversation to stuff we could talk about freely.\n&#8220;Tussle?&#8221;\n&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to phrase it so I don&#8217;t hurt your feelings, Sy,&#8221; Gordon said, sounding as condescending as he was able.\xa0 &#8220;Because if I was honest, I&#8217;d have to say you didn&#8217;t just embarrass yourself.\xa0 You embarrassed all of us.&#8221;\nI jabbed him.\xa0 He took it without flinching.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m guessing that, following your usual pattern, you&#8217;re going to get in trouble, ostensibly to see how the justice system of Mothmont operates?&#8221;\xa0 Gordon asked.\nThe question could be taken two ways.\xa0 Anyone hearing would think I was a troublemaker, which wasn&#8217;t wrong, but he was asking if I&#8217;d see which faces or individuals might be tied to the correction of errant students.\xa0 Or errant &#8216;bad seeds&#8217;, as the case went.\nThe maneuver had other uses.\xa0 If our opposition here was less graceful, they might well get themselves into trouble, just to follow me or keep an eye on me.\xa0 Simply paying attention to see who acted and reacted after I got myself into trouble could reveal a great deal.\nBut my answer to Gordon was a, &#8220;Not just yet.&#8221;\n&#8220;No?&#8221;\n&#8220;Still waiting to see what happens after my brawl with Ed.&#8221;\nJamie, trailing a bit behind us, snickered audibly.\nGordon openly scoffed.\xa0 &#8220;Brawl.\xa0 You got beat, Sy.\xa0 I was talking to some of the others, and Ed actually got worried when someone suggested that you might be a real scrapper, growing up in the orphanage.\xa0 I nearly split something, trying not to laugh.&#8221;\n&#8220;Ha ha,&#8221; I said, without humor.\nWe reached the end of the dining room, and the girls were filtering in through the door on the far side. \xa0 It was nice, very spacious, all long tables of dark wood, benches, with the two sides separated by a buffet style table.\nThe kitchen was visible, a recessed area, with the chefs busy at work over various stoves.\xa0 Students aged twelve to sixteen were wearing aprons, carrying food out.\xa0 Racks of bread, bowls of salad and empty glasses were placed on the table, while larger pots of food were placed on the buffet table, beside stacks of plates.\xa0 Stew, soups, and portions of meat.\nFrom the smell in the kitchen, they were already working on dessert.\nI took it all in, studying it.\xa0 The system.\nGordon leaned close, murmuring, &#8220;Put yourself into their shoes.\xa0 How many ways can you see, to poison someone?&#8221;\n&#8220;Pre-assigned seats?&#8221; I asked.\n&#8220;No, but they&#8217;ll call us together by homeroom for a roll call soon,&#8221; Jamie said.\n&#8220;Make sure all the students are present and accounted for,&#8221; Gordon elaborated.\nDust the glasses with something, poison the silverware, deliver the poison while serving water, refresh the bread bowl or salad, drop something in the food while we go from the buffet to our seats, or simply take advantage of the bumps and shoves that come with being in a crowd of hungry students to stick us with a needle.\n&#8220;Seven off the top of my head.&#8221;\n&#8220;Lillian and I counted out twelve ways they could&#8217;ve gotten me, looking back in retrospect,&#8221; Gordon murmured.\xa0 &#8220;Jamie and Helen added one each once they got back from the Academy.&#8221;\n&#8220;Kind of takes the joy out of eating for the first time in a week,&#8221; I murmured.\n&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t eat too much on an empty stomach anyway,&#8221; Jamie said.\nI made a face, but I didn&#8217;t take my eyes off the crowd.\xa0 I saw Helen and Lillian on the other side.\xa0 Helen had a bevvy of girls around her, and she was playing it up.\xa0 Lillian stood off to one side, talking to a teacher.\nOddly in her element, in a very not-the-way-she-acts-at-home way.\n&#8220;Incidentally,&#8221; I said, still looking over the crowd for a glimpse of the boys I&#8217;d seen through the window.\xa0 I didn&#8217;t see any telltale signs, and I certainly didn&#8217;t see them together as a group.\xa0 &#8220;What do we do if I happen to spot a possible culprit?&#8221;\n&#8220;Signal me and Helen.\xa0 We&#8217;ll go after him.&#8221;\nI nodded.\xa0 &#8220;Easier if you&#8217;re together.&#8221;\n&#8220;We&#8217;ll sit together as a group.&#8221;\n&#8220;Okay,&#8221; I said.\nSure enough, we were called to specific tables by our homeroom teachers.\xa0 They read our names off of lists, and then gave the official go-ahead to get food.\nI held back out of the way while everyone stampeded for the buffet table, or ran over to reunite with friends.\xa0 Nobody returned to the seats they&#8217;d been in for the nightly attendance, and the teachers didn&#8217;t enforce anything.\xa0 There were striations by year and groupings of cliques, but no divisions beyond that.\nHelen approached with a group of her friends, while Gordon went to go talk to his clique.\xa0 The teenagers had all gathered around the buffet table and were screening out the kids, claiming first pick, but Gordon&#8217;s group looked set to take up the first gap that formed.\nI appreciated that he going out of his way to stay in our line of sight, allowing us to watch his back.\n&#8220;Sy, was it?&#8221; one of Helen&#8217;s older friends asked.\xa0 An attractive brunette with her hair in a short bob.\xa0 She&#8217;d hiked up her skirt just a fraction beneath her uniform top, so the bottom of the skirt was higher, revealing more of her very nice looking legs.\nI realized I&#8217;d been caught looking, and met her eyes without a trace of shame or guilt, &#8220;You can call me whatever you want, so long as you give me your name first, and maybe the number of your dorm room.&#8221;\nShe smiled, amid some &#8216;oohs&#8217; from other girls in the group, then gave me a pat on the head.\xa0 &#8220;That was a good try, and it might have worked, but you&#8217;re a little too young for me, and I like the idea of a man who can stand up for me.&#8221;\n&#8220;You saw my duel with Ed,&#8221; I spoke my realization aloud.\n&#8220;I did,&#8221; she said.\xa0 &#8220;I&#8217;d offer some comforting words, but the less that&#8217;s said, the better.&#8221;\n&#8220;I could say I let him win,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;Did you?&#8221; another girl chimed in, interest piqued.\xa0 Blonde, like Helen, but more pixieish in many respects.\xa0 Helen could have been an actress or a model, but this girl made me imagine a ballerina, in build and how she was more expressive in general movement.\n&#8220;No.\xa0 But I could say I did,&#8221; I said.\n&#8220;Whatever convinced you to pick a fight with Ed Willard?&#8221; the brunette asked.\n&#8220;Some people are born to be the hero of a story,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;I was born to be the villain.\xa0 I see the charming, good looking, obnoxiously noble type of guy and I feel compelled to start a battle I&#8217;m doomed to lose.&#8221;\n&#8220;Does that include monologues while you&#8217;re winning and standing over the bloody hero?&#8221; another girl asked, a smile on her face, suggesting she was well versed in that sort of thing.\xa0 Not many girls read the books and dime novels meant for boys.\n&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t know,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;You saw my poor showing earlier.\xa0 I haven&#8217;t gotten that far.&#8221;\nI heard a few chuckles and smiles, and belatedly realized that I&#8217;d effectively and accidentally drawn the attention of Helen&#8217;s entire clique.\xa0 Heads at other tables and the buffet line were turning, looking at me as some of the more attractive girls in our grade were grouped around me.\n&#8220;Okay, wait, I have to poke a hole in your story,&#8221; a girl closer to Helen&#8217;s and my age declared.\xa0 She was a brunette too, but wore her hair longer, with white ribbons that complemented her school uniform.\xa0 &#8220;You say you don&#8217;t get along with good guys, but you get along with Helen&#8217;s friend Gordon, don&#8217;t you?\xa0 If anyone&#8217;s noble, it&#8217;s him.&#8221;\n&#8220;Oh, Gordon&#8217;s a villain at heart,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if he knows it yet, but there&#8217;s a scoundrel in there just screaming for an excuse.&#8221;\n&#8220;How would you know that?&#8221; she asked.\n&#8220;Because when I was showing these guys around, I saw them with all sorts of people, sometimes in the rougher parts of town.\xa0 I&#8217;ve seen Gordon here, all nice and ordinary, and I&#8217;ve seen him go toe to toe with people you wouldn&#8217;t want to meet in a dark alley, and they walked away respecting him.&#8221;\nA half dozen pairs of eyes turned Gordon&#8217;s way.\xa0 He caught sight of a crowd of girls giving him serious looks and looked about as bewildered as if I&#8217;d drawn a gun on him.\nMiss Ribbons wasn&#8217;t looking though.\xa0 She was focused on me, her right eyebrow raised.\xa0 &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I believe you.&#8221;\nPixie-blonde chimed in, turning from Gordon to Ribbons, and then to me.\xa0 She put her hands on her hips.\xa0 &#8220;Are you being a good friend and trying to get us interested in your fellow over there?&#8221;\n&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; I said, smiling.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s good if you&#8217;ve given up on making yourself look good, because that ship sailed hours ago,&#8221; Miss Ribbons commented.\n&#8220;That&#8217;s cruel,&#8221; another girl said.\xa0 &#8220;I quite like Sy, here, and it&#8217;s noble of this little villain to play up his friend.&#8221;\nWith the words &#8216;I quite like Sy&#8217;, she put her arms around me, giving me a hug.\xa0 I very nearly ducked out of her grip, but a quick glance at each of her hands suggested that they were empty, with no weapon or needle in evidence.\xa0 Given the difference in stature, the girl being three years my senior, it pulled the side of my head right into her bosom.\nA nearby teacher loudly cleared his throat, and my new friend pulled her arms away, raising her hands as if she were being held up.\n&#8220;Believe it or not,&#8221; Helen said, still smiling, acting very much the young coquette, &#8220;Sy isn&#8217;t lying.\xa0 For once.\xa0 What he said about Gordon was true.&#8221;\nThat line spawned more conversation, but my focus was on Gordon.\xa0 He navigated his way through eager young students, holding four plates in two hands.\xa0 He looked a little wary of joining the group, with so many eyes on him.\n&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; he asked, once he was close enough to ask.\n&#8220;Just talking,&#8221; Helen said.\n&#8220;Healthy lad,&#8221; the girl who&#8217;d hugged me said, indicating Gordon&#8217;s plates.\n&#8220;For my friends,&#8221; Gordon said.\nLingering paranoia made me study her expression for any hint of danger.\xa0 Had she powdered her shirtfront with a poison that could be inhaled?\nGordon handed us our individual plates, one for me, Helen, Lillian and Jamie, then asked, &#8220;Is anyone in dire need of a meal?\xa0 I was going to go back to serve myself, but I can get more plates.&#8221;\nThe short-haired brunette raised her hand, smiling way too much at Gordon.\n&#8220;That&#8217;s one,&#8221; he said.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m getting waved over,&#8221; Miss Ribbons said.\xa0 &#8220;I need to take over for a friend and start serving.\xa0 She&#8217;s been in the kitchen all day.&#8221;\n&#8220;Good girl.\xa0 Talk to you later,&#8221; Helen said.\n&#8220;Enjoy your meals,&#8221; Miss Ribbons said, before dashing off.\nI watched her retreat, zig-zagging through the crowd on the way to the kitchen, hair and skirt bouncing before she reunited with the friend she&#8217;d mentioned.\nShe glanced back, looking at me.\n&#8220;I do think Mary likes Sy,&#8221; Pixie-blonde said.\n&#8220;Does Sy like Mary?&#8221; another girl asked.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m going to sit,&#8221; Helen said.\xa0 &#8220;Come sit with us, Sy.\xa0 I don&#8217;t think these girls are going to let you go, like this.\xa0 They&#8217;ve got their claws in you, and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll let you go.&#8221;\n&#8220;Claws?&#8221; a girl asked, archly.\nHelen, doing her part to keep us together in a very natural seeming way.\nIt took time before everyone had a plate and food.\xa0 My focus was on the crowd, keeping only enough attention on the conversation to keep up with it.\xa0 Where were the dynamics?\xa0 What were the possible approaches for attack?\nI was exceedingly aware of the state of my food.\xa0 On such an empty stomach, I couldn&#8217;t afford to get poisoned.\xa0 We already knew our enemies were aware of us, so I didn&#8217;t mind being a little guarded.\xa0 One girl commented on it, even, and I explained it away as a casualty of being from the orphanage.\xa0 That, in itself, spawned more discussion.\nJamie and Lillian seemed content to be in the background.\xa0 Jamie was taking it all in.\xa0 If something happened, he&#8217;d be able to tell us who was where.\nHad I been familiar with the dynamic and the situation, I might have been more on point, aware of when it all started to go wrong.\xa0 It tied into what Jamie had said about the prey instinct.\xa0 Taking in the subconscious details, things that one&#8217;s mind and attention weren&#8217;t picking up on.\nChanges in volume, shifts in tone.\xa0 The behavior of people at the fringes and in the background.\nLittle boys who were hunched over their plates.\nIt only clicked when I saw that dessert was being served, and that the cooks and serving girls were looking a little nonplussed.\xa0 I paid attention to what they were sensing with their own prey&#8217;s instinct.\nThat dessert was being placed on the table, and very few students seemed inclined to go get it.\nLooking around, I saw expressions of pain.\xa0 People squirming.\xa0 Not a lot, but as I watched, I saw it was getting worse.\nI dropped my knife and fork.\n&#8220;Don&#8217;t eat,&#8221; I said.\nHelen, Gordon, Lillian, and Jamie dropped their utensils.\nThey didn&#8217;t settle for poisoning us.\nThey poisoned everyone.\nWhy?\n&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Erma, the pixie-haired blonde said.\xa0 &#8220;I thought I felt full, but now-&#8221;\nShe raised a hand to her mouth.\n&#8220;Just nausea?&#8221; Lillian asked.\xa0 She got a nod.\xa0 &#8220;Feverish?\xa0 Does it hurt?&#8221;\nWhatever she was feeling, I didn&#8217;t experience it.\xa0 My friends didn&#8217;t either.\nMaybe a handful of people had escaped it, whatever it was.\nMy mind was going a mile a minute as I took it in, tried to figure out the approach.\nWhat was the goal, the plan?\nThey&#8217;d hit everyone, but missed us.\xa0 Was it an accident, luck on our part, Gordon being safe?\n&#8220;The teachers are affected too,&#8221; Gordon said.\n&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem to be serious,&#8221; Lillian said.\xa0 &#8220;It&#8217;ll get explained away as a stomach thing.\xa0 Something improperly cooked, perhaps.&#8221;\nAs if to answer her statement, someone threw up.\xa0 It seemed to set off a chain reaction.\xa0 People were rising from their seats, hurrying out of the dining hall.\n&#8220;The entire school is going to be shut down,&#8221; I said.\xa0 &#8220;Everyone in their beds for at least the next few hours, if not the next day.&#8221;\nEveryone.\xa0 It&#8217;s not a frame, or they would have left the teachers alone, done more to set us up.\xa0 Again, I have to wonder&#8230; why?\nMy eye fell on Miss Ribbons.\nI felt the uneasiness, watching her.\xa0 I saw the look in her eyes.\xa0 Just the same as the boys had been.\nI jerked my head, and the others looked, following my gaze.\xa0 Miss Ribbons was already making a hasty exit, pulling off her apron.\xa0 If anyone asked, I bet she&#8217;d say she was going to the nurse.\n&#8220;Nobody to look after us, or keep us out of trouble,&#8221; I commented.\nLocking down the school.\xa0 They were largely free to roam, or to feign being sick until our backs were turned, but I suspected it wouldn&#8217;t be so easy or safe for us.\nThey&#8217;re making a play, and we&#8217;re still completely in the dark about what they are and what they&#8217;re doing.\nPrevious\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Next\n\t\t\t']]
