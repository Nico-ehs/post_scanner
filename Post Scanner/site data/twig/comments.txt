All the men were engaged in active surveillance, which involves closely monitoring a patient’s condition through screening and biopsies.\nTen of the patients embarked on lifestyle changes that included: a plant-based diet (high in fruits, vegetables and unrefined grains, and low in fat and refined carbohydrates); moderate exercise (walking 30 minutes a day, six days a week); stress reduction (gentle yoga-based stretching, breathing, meditation). They also participated in weekly group support.  \nThey were compared to the other 25 study participants who were not asked to make major lifestyle changes.\nThe group that made the lifestyle changes experienced a “significant” increase in telomere length of approximately 10 percent. Further, the more people changed their behavior by adhering to the recommended lifestyle program, the more dramatic their improvements in telomere length, the scientists learned.\nBy contrast, the men in the control group who were not asked to alter their lifestyle had measurably shorter telomeres – nearly 3 percent shorter – when the five-year study ended.

And of course, the upper class basically &#8216;butchering&#8217; the lower class is a common idea in a lot of British Lit.\n&#8211; Which brings me to my next point: I know Wildbow is Canadian, but for some reason this post felt British to me. Maybe it&#8217;s just where my head is at, but the combination of wild-but-precocious schoolchildren, class issues (I might be making that angle up, but it just feels like there&#8217;s something there), and the gentleman-butcher felt British.\n&#8211; It&#8217;s way to soon to be talking like this but oh what the hell: Sylvester is already my favorite Wildbow protagonist.

Namely, you have a tendency of sometimes producing very wordy verbal descriptions of physical settings that are not very easy to read, and really distract from the telling of the story. Here is an example right at the beginning of Twig:\n&#8220;What had once been a barn had been made into a warehouse, then abandoned partway through a third set of changes.  A floor of old wooden slats reached only halfway down the length of the old building, what had once been a hayloft.  If we stood on the edge, we could look down at the floor below to see uneven floorboards on top of compacted dirt.  The original barn’s door was still there, mounted on rollers.  I leaned over to get a better look.  I could see a table, some scattered papers, books, and a blackboard.  The only light was that which came in through windows.  A scattered set placed on the upper floor, and more well above head height on the lower one.&#8221;\nConvoluted wording, hard to picture precisely. Very much an element of the writing in Pact that I had serious trouble with. And&#8211; I would suggest&#8211; absolutely not the sort of thing you want in one of the first paragraphs of a new story, where you are looking to ensnare readers without long descriptions of setting (unless such descriptions were really compelling, which this is not).\nPerhaps the hardest thing for me as a reader when I come across these descriptions is why you considered those particular physical details so important as to put on paper. I would like for physical descriptions to be much more natural and organic, and flow seamlessly with the story itself.\nAnyway, that&#8217;s my honest feedback as a longtime reader.\nWishing you all the best with your new venture, and I will continue to read what you write and support your efforts as long as possible.\n'], ['twig', 'Taking Root 1.1', '235', 'Last Place |', '2015-03-10T19:15:48+00:00', '1', 'Had to sit down and force myself to wait all day just like Pact.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, Taylor and Blake were each compelling in their own way, but I&#8217;m something of a sucker for trickery and plots, and that&#8217;s not really an element that either of them could bring to the table. Taylor is intelligent, and a master of leveraging force against her foes, but she was rather lacking in the &#8220;methods of success besides force&#8221; department. Blake and Rose were both a bit better with that, but the situation they were in was set up so that they were so busy with other people&#8217;s plans that they could never really make their own. From what I can see here, Sy is very much a trickster, and I like that. \nWater is clearly bad for stitched, and there&#8217;s some evidence here that the children (besides Lilian) are, themselves, stitched. From Sy&#8217;s behavior, he seems determined to ignore the danger. I see three possible reasons for this (note that these are not mutually exclusive):\n1) aversion to water is psychological, and Sy is working to over come it\n2)  A tolerance of sorts to water&#8217;s detrimental effects if one is dedicated enough to suffer from it in the mean time (This also begs the question of why water is damaging. My best guess is that a catalyst for chemical reactions like water is not something you want near delicate artifical biochemistry)\n3) Sy is dangerously reckless of his own health and well being\nI&#8217;m guessing that stitched is a term for someone who&#8217;s been Bonesaw&#8217;d in one sense or another.

The way he oscilates between being genuinely affectionate and caring for his teammates and feeling really distant from them strikes me as&#8230;odd. (eg. Feeling nice about Helen when working on Ed, but being afraid of her when her act is up. Being touched at being asked for, but also planning on rubbing their faces in the fact that they *need* him.) There&#8217;s also the fact that his programmer, Hayle, expects him to think of the Lambridge gang as family, and Sy thinks of them as a gang. Considering the fact that the kids were almost certainly programmed to like each other, to work as a group, I suspect that the oscilations are a sign that Sy&#8217;s programming is unstable. \nMore information about the abilities of the group. Jamie is the library of the group, there to store and retrieve information, (and maybe also to take in seemingly unrelated information to make a stronger conclusion, like a psedo Tattletale). Helen is the infiltrator of the group, the one best equipped to create fake personalities and covers for any given situation. Sy is a schemer, and also the information seeker to Jamie&#8217;s library. He makes situations where useful information falls out, Jaimie memorizes the data for later use. Gordon is the charismatic one, the person there to convince large crowds and civilians to do x, y, and z. He&#8217;s also the group&#8217;s main guardian, going out of his way to make sure that his less careful teammates make it home in one piece. \nMy best guess for the source of the killings is that it&#8217;s the result of some sort of surgically implanted thing that triggers violent compulsions under the right conditions. The earlier chapter mentioned that the killings were being refined over time, which means that the means can be adjusted on the fly with relative ease. This means that it&#8217;s probably not, say, a brain parasite or poison that hits the murder button the first time someone familiar enough enters the subject&#8217;s line of sight.

A party of gentlemen were invited to look upon the experiment, that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration. Twelve wagons were loaded with stones, till each wagon weighed three tons, and the wagons were fastened together. A horse was then attached, which drew the wagons with ease, six miles in two hours, having stopped four times, in order to show he had the power of starting, as well as drawing his great load&#8221;\ni figure that, wherever they lay down tracks within a city, train or not, they&#8217;re pretty much going to lay them close to the dividing line between the good/medium and the bad parts of the city.  Anyone with money isn&#8217;t going to want to live near the tracks, and laying down fresh tracks in good neighborhoods is going to upset a lot of people and cost a lot more money than running a line through cheaper buildings/real estate.  So you&#8217;re going to want to lay down tracks in bad/poor areas, but as close to the better areas as you can, so there&#8217;s generally going to be a poorer side and a richer side.\nYou&#8217;re going to want to get as close to the better areas as possible because 1) it&#8217;ll cut down on the cost of transport (goods will likely flow much more readily to/from the good side).  Also, 2) there&#8217;s going to be a gentrification force acting on the main roads to/from the good side to any stations, and there&#8217;s going to be spillover that&#8217;ll further reinforce the good/bad sides.  As more wealthy people travel to/from the station, their pathways are going to be upgraded, because people with money don&#8217;t want to see that trash on the road, or have to associate with riff-raff while they get their business done.  The road to any station on the other side, though, likely won&#8217;t be gong through gentrification, though.

I recall in Boil someone getting kicked out from the Academy because her dissertation wasn&#8217;t good enough; does someone with a background good enough to get into Mothmont get to try again if that happens, or does their safety net go away once they actually get in?\nIt feels as though I really need to read Boil again, and see if the protagonist getting kicked out there was because of a (limited) scholarship, not being able to pay to stay longer.  The premise there&#8230;  somehow I can&#8217;t find Boil, though.  Concerning.\n&#8216;They’re tools':  easily surmisable from the description of what happened, one way or another.  *nods*\nI&#8217;m bothered by that I didn&#8217;t follow the end of the gun situation metaphor.  Is the &#8216;being nice to Sylvester&#8217; the shooting or the apologising?  Maybe the apologising, something that doesn&#8217;t help the person who&#8217;s going to be shot&#8230;  Lacey could be described as &#8216;having a gun to her head&#8217; in terms of pressures to succeed or fail/drop out, but that&#8217;s not directly relevant in any case (I think?)&#8230;  there&#8217;s the question of what /would/ be for Sy&#8217;s sake, what he would actually be happy if she did (other than not treat him with pity and fake caring).  Let him out?  Overturn the Academy somehow to get human rights for his gang, or try?  Also, arguably all altruism is a fulfilment of the altruist&#8217;s own utility function, but&#8211;or rather, and so&#8211;actions can still be treated as for another&#8217;s sake.  Apologising to someone doesn&#8217;t help them if you&#8217;re going to kill them, /but/ anaesthesia can be helpful to someone undergoing mad scientist experimental surgery, and sheets/clothes can be helpful to someone who feels cold particularly painfully following skin replacement.  If someone who&#8217;s going to perform inhuman experimental surgery on oneself doesn&#8217;t raise the success rate by using anaesthesia, but does so anyone so that you will be more comfortable, then is that person resented for doing it for their sake, not for one&#8217;s own?  Then again, this abstract level of consideration is moot if we take into account Sy&#8217;s observations of Lacey&#8217;s pity/dislike/etc. and assume that it can be treated as a given that she&#8217;s not doing it out of altruísm, and that he can tell.  In that case, we could predict that someone who did the exact same things wouldn&#8217;t be resented by him if that person actually wanted to help him, even if it was also that person&#8217;s job.  Hmmm.  There&#8217;s still a gap though where those emotions and the apologising/shooting metaphor have to be overlaid to make sense, which they currently aren&#8217;t in the description of the four hypothetical people.  Hm.\n&#8216;you definitely don’t have a gun to your head.  If you’re being nice to me, it’s for your benefit, not mine':  this especially doesn&#8217;t seem to follow.  If one didn&#8217;t have a gun to one&#8217;s head, wouldn&#8217;t that make one&#8217;s positive actions less for one&#8217;s benefit than if done out of self-preservation..?  Unless that&#8217;s saying &#8216;so you&#8217;re choosing to take the negative actions&#8217;, which loops back to the question of what negative actions she&#8217;s doing that he&#8217;d want her not to do&#8230;\nThinking more generally, as well, about the &#8216;appointment&#8217;s.  Something like regular necessary maintenance, also stopping the four from killing Hayle and fleeing?\nAs a final thought (returning to my second paragraph), the attempts on their lives conveniently make it easier to get leads and trace cause and effect back to the ultimate culprits, but also lower the amount of investigation that needs to be done and plunges the context into physical beat-or-be-beaten territory again.
