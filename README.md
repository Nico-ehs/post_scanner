This rails app that creates and charts metadata on blog comments. This is a early stage work in progress and I'm still testing out some basic features. The app is being run at https://post-scanner-243653.herokuapp.com/. I'm using a few posts form https://twigserial.wordpress.com/ as a sample since high traffic web fiction provides good data. For chart display it using the chartkick gem and highcharts. Other UI features haven't been implemented. For web-scraping it uses separate python code in the "Post Scanner" folder. It currently can do WordPress blog though it requires tweaking for each site.
