==Post Scanner==

This rails app that creates and charts metadata on blog comments. This is a early stage work in progress and I'm still testing out some basic features. The app is being run at:

- https://post-scanner-243653.herokuapp.com/. 

I'm using a few posts from https://twigserial.wordpress.com/ and For chart display it using the chartkick gem and highcharts. Other UI features haven't been implemented. For web-scraping it uses separate python code in the "Post Scanner" folder. It currently can do WordPress blog though it requires tweaking for each site.
